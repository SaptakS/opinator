Brilliant book by the Little Master. It felt as if Sachin himself is in front of me and telling his life's story. Very nice book.
Good...could have been better...but am glad that GOD himself incarnated and penned down some(not all) of his hidden treasures!!!
Amazing Book. Great efforts put on by all the persons to make it successful. Easy read and attention grabbing events. Thank You.
From Amazon perspective, it was delivered on time. The book is worth a read for anybody inIndia who loves cricket and Sachin.
The book is great. All credit goes to Sachin not to you guys. Your delivery was pathetic. The delivery was delayed by 4 days.
Honesty Is The Name Of The God Of The Cricket ....... Every Cricketeer Should Must Read It....
I Recomended For Everyone
The experience go through the life with GOD of cricket the narration is simply superb it is the bible for SACHIN lovers. . .
Amazing service by amazon.
I thoroughly enjoyed the book .
His way of the play , is an inspiration .
Absolutely amazing! Don't hesitate, its that man! this book is from his heart! go get a copy! #ThankYouSachin once more! and prompt delivery by amazon! the book was released on 6th and I received it on 8th at around 1 pm.
Nice quality, immediate delivery, packing a bit uneven, but no damage to the book.....nice experience....Fully satisfied!
This is an autibiography that would appeal to the diehard sachin fans. For me personally, it was a nostalgic read , reliving all his matches with some interesting titbits here and there. But for someone who hasn't followed his career so closely or someone who is cricket neutral , an endless grind of all his matches awaits you!
Great insights into the mind of one of the best batsman of the world. Some of the instances on how he interprets the ball before it is delivered talks volumes about the ability of this individual. Ideal only for people who have followed Indian cricket over years. The last part i.e. his retirement speech still gives goosebumps.
Great read... If u r an avid cricket fan then u can relate to the tournaments Sachin mentions... If u don't follow cricket closely u will still enjoy learning about the game. We often feel that Sachin is an effortless player but this book shows the immense hardwork he has put in and how consciously Sachin tries to be grounded
Like every one I also hoped the best from him.But it was not like an autobiography but can tell it as match to match statistics.Because it is really not an autobiography as written by Boria Mazumdar and Sachin has given him interviews.But it is not bad to buy it.Some recalls from Sachin about his life are worth to know....
I bought the autobiography with a lot of expectations and none were fulfilled - not written interestingly enough and not much insight into what was happening in his mind and in the cricket field. The silence on the match fixing controversy which affected so many of his colleagues is very disappointing. Overall a poor buy
Really very nice and wonderful one all the experience has place in reality way. It is extrimly difficult to place the cricket experience in form of book.
Really a great player our god of cricket and master blaster and little master.
SACHIN TENDULKAR SIR.

Its an Awesome Book for Sachin Fans Specially when you take him as your God. And yes for non Sachin fans too its a wonderful book to read some real life fact files of the super human. Does not let you down. And yes if you have Sachin fans who don't buy the book gift them one as i did. Gives greater Joy.
It's hard to believe the way sachin handled everything at such a big stage for so long.....to predict the next  delivery even before the bowler has started his runup, shows his greatness!!!!!
Surely the content justifies the title of the book....What
 a man..... Sorry..... "SUPERMAN"
Amazing book with amazing illustrations. Brings back memories of childhood and eager waiting of master blaster to come on pitch. The alacrity with which Sachin has faced so many injuries and still served nation through cricket is totally inspiring. Respect aa hi jata hai bande ke liye... Sab padh ke.
He s a champ,the book has its mettle in proving that,but yes ,would have been happier if I would get to know more about his personal life other than cricket.....anyway I can understand he is not a writer by profession..this man is worth a salute,good read to reassure that anything can be achieved!!
I bought it for my husband who is a diehard Sachin fan...he not only follows his cricketing style but also adores him as the man himself off the field, his ideologies.I thought this book will have enough of the later one so pre-booked and gifted him...But While I started reading it I could just find that other than few small stories here and there Sachin has not really opened up himself  in this book to every situation;he has not stated how he thought,what was his reaction,thought process etc...It is true that he is such a talked about figure that nothing was unknown about him but wanted to see all these hard work,success,humility,honesty from his perspective....I felt that this book lacks that..other than few unknown stories (Anjali chapter, may be a little of Greg Chappel story(this hardly would be 10 liners)) it seemed to me like a match report summary of his entire carrier...Sachin fans please excuse me..but I stand by what I said... Thanks!!
It was an OK book. I was expecting an insight into his life whereas the book takes the reader to various incidents/ experiences and leaves it to the reader to form his opinion . Of course , very readable and simply presented
I am an ardent fan of Tendulkar and all through his cricketing years i used to be a vocal supporter and die-hard fan. In fact I have stopped watching cricket when he has retired. Now cricket is boring thing for me. I have bought this book with great expectations and I must say I am deeply disappointed. I cannot digest Sachin finding fault with Dravid for declaring the innings in Multan, Pakistan because he cannot get his double hundred. When I bought the book I did not expect it to be mystery thriller or page turner. But this book is a real bore. Only snippets here and there were interesting. Only the high regard for Sachin made me to buy this book.
Finished going through every pages of my Holy Book Playing it My Way the Autobiography of my God. The respect, Love, Devotion i had for him is just multiplied by infinite. Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of reading for the first time ever in my life, it took only 2 day's and night for me to complete the book of nearly 480 pages.
Top three phases of book I liked is:
1. When Sachin woke up in a middle of his surgery in April 2003. Went under knife on his left hand ring finger due to a calcification, he was so worried surgery will be made on his palm and the will force him to change the way he grips the bat.
It not merely out of loyalty that I give this book 5 stars, it really is a worthy read for anyone who has followed him and also very young generation who want to understand why he has a special place in our hearts... Him talking about his favourite series which ironically turns out to be the one where he bowled wonderfully in the last match, and world cup 2003 with the trials and tribulations of nervousness and dehydration and real exhaustion and still finding the strength to carry on... I hoped he would talk about the 98 against Pakistan and he did, and I dont think he realises how inspiring it is to hear his anecdotal reference to the preparation before the next match, for him its probably just an embarrassingly funny story... but as a reader I felt ashamed of how laid-back I am about my passions.
The chapter on his wife and marriage is kind of the stuff romantic movies are made of, pretty sure some filmmaker will realise it soon.. anyway, it seems I can ramble on about this... in a nutshell, its wonderful book... yeah there is no scandoloud expose about matchfixing, but I knew that even before I read it, cause you know him, Its just not his way ;)
This is my first review here and I am so glad its for a book he wrote
The book as such reads like a Journal - mostly a running commentary of matches (although important, key matches) which gets monotonous after a while. That is something, since all the matches mentioned are the milestone matches in Sachin's career and for any fan of Indian cricket, that holds considerable interest.
Sachin's relations within his family, especially with his kids, with teammates, and the food he had during his tours, besides personal anecdotes from some of the matches are broadly the highlights of the book. Also,finer points of his playing technique are mentioned here and there, which would be of interest to the keen follower of the game.
The part of the book that lets you down is its non-controversial stand on most issues. Match fixing is mentioned only in passing, barely a few pages are dedicated to the Monkeygate scandal. BCCI is held up in high esteem almost everywhere. Most surprisingly, Yuvraj Singh's struggle with cancer and Sachin's stint with the Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member do not find a mention in this book.
It is still worth buying and reading, because it is Sachin after all. The pictures generously sprinkled within the book are a collector's delight. What strikes one throughout the book is the straightforward, uncomplicated approach that Sachin seems to have towards his life. That alongwith the devotion towards family, the patriotism and the attention to the minutest details of the sport are the key impressions one could treasure, as we complete this book.
Being a vivid Sachin fan I expected more of thought process and behind the screens happenings in the game and in the dressing room. But this book is disappointment on this front. This book is more of various essays about all his innings put together.
Even after reading the book you wont get a feeling that you know Sachin more than before reading it.
I am a big fan of Sachin. Got this book thinking will get to see it from the masters point of view. Have to say that I was disappointed. Pretty much what was in the newspaper and various columns were all collected and logically arranged.
If you are fan and feel that you need to have a copy of this for your collection, then buy it otherwise you can give it a pass.
When you follow a sports personality and the game passionately for so long, you'd expect the life story to be equally riveting. This books while good and informative falls short of being great. It seems rather superficial and gives you nothing but a bit more than what is already known about the man. It doesn't help that there are pages and pages of statistics which seem to be there for the sole purpose of filling up pages.
It would've been nice to have some personal views from the man on things like the match fixing scandal and his views of Azharuddin and Jadeja getting caught in the storm, his relationship with Vinod Kambli or even more anectodes if being on tour. Maybe, like with his batting we come to expect too much from him...
The first thing I saw and liked about the book is its photographs. The book has a nice collection of pictures from Sachin's playing career. He brings to life the old test matches of the late 90's  which many people of my age started watching cricket with. His criticisms of the people around him are very subtle but if recognised, one is sure to have a good laugh at them. The tone of his writing, as expected is very idealistic(which is very typical to Sachin Tendulkar) but likeable for a fan like me. If the reader is not a great fan, he/she might not like this as much.
The book is an above average read. If you are a fan, you will like this in your collection. However, if you are not, this might not be liked a lot.
There's nothing in it which we don't know. Rather than describing his hardships and mental make-up for the game, the book just feels like a scorecard and summary of every series he played. If you are not a cricket fan, you should stay away from this and if you are one, then too you will be disappointed with this.
Very poor writing (almost high school standards), and hardly any personal insights. The book reads like a paraphrasing of scorecards from the past. A safe and rather bland offering from which, I would strongly recommend, any bibliophile stay miles away.
In last 20 odd years, I loved reading anything written on Sachin and was hoping for great insight about this man. Honestly, it was bit disappointing except for first few chapters and last few chapters. I felt like some of the contents were rushed through in hurry. Though I'm not dissapointed by Sachin himself, but certainly Author has done poor job in extracting best out of Sachin and articulating in rather insightful way. Perhaps, it would have been good idea to write multiple volumes rather than rushing through all in one shot. No matter what, my admiration for Sachin will be same forever.
Finished reading the book " Playing It My Way" an autobiography of Sachin Tendulkar. For those in search of any sensational revelations in the book, it is a a disappointment. Nobody expects from a person who has steered clear of any controversy during his playing days, to create any sort of controversy at this stage. Though a major portion of the book just appears as statement of facts, hence repetition of what is already universally known , the author should not be blamed for that because the events surrounding Tendulkar ,on and off the field, have unfolded before us in the last 25 years or so. In the narrative, there are many instances of mind games played and strategies adopted to outwit the opposition which makes up for very interesting reading. A disappointing aspect in the book, however is that the author has not devoted much space to some of his great contemporaries. No mention is made about Kapil Dev's final appearance in test cricket though Sachin was a member of the team at that time. More surprisingly, some of the gem of innings played by Rahul Dravid hardly gets mentioned.Though Rahul and Sachin partnered in Test maches in 143 innings, and scored 6905 runs as partners with 20 century and 29 half century partnerships,it is surprising that Rahul's achievements and his contribution to Indian cricket has not found any place in the book. In this respect, Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S.Laxman should consider themselves slightly better off.
To sum up, much more was expected from Sachin Tendulkar,not only about himself, but also for his insights about those greats who played along with him and against him.

I go through the book, we respect the achivement of sachin tendulkar, but not his book, its not containing what we expected. it is like a redaing of his match innings,  90% of episode we knowing earlier. only good thing is i got the copy with lower price by amazon.in

I think it's a very simple narration of key events of his life that made him the person he is. I liked it. There were many things we get to know about Sachin's professional as well as personal life.
If expecting an immensely motivational or dramatically controversial, this is not the book. It's simple and honest just like Sachin himself.
The book is well written and the enthusiam of Tendulkar is well captured... However could have been better if he himself wrote it. Many times it feels very unlike Tendulkar. Also Tendulkar is made to guiltless in the entire book and all his bad performances are made out to be due to circumstances and luck, which is something untrue.
Must have for all Sachin fans. Official one from the Little Master Himself.
Very simple and easy to read language. I personally found his schooling years, the struggles and the Shardhashram days most interesting and it will bring a smile to anyone.
Many photographs, stats etc.
Overall a good read
Let me make it clear that I consider myself the greatest Sachin fan alive. However I shall try to be fair in my review.
The first 100 or so pages that described Sachin's childhood formed the best part of the book. You would laugh, smile, get astonished and surprised ("Sachin used to do this to?" ...you would think). You will find that Sachin was, in most ways, the same cricket loving kid you were and will be able to relate to many of his mischief,ideas and thoughts.
However the fun ends along with those chapters. The rest of the book is a like a commentary of his matches. Almost all the matches have been included. It will refresh your memories of Sachin's batting, and you will relive some of the matches you might have forgotten.
However for a Sachin fan who would have certainly followed most of his career and would have all of his matches strong in his memory, this is provides little comfort. You expect more from Sachin than just summary of his matches.
Like most of the books on Sachin, this one too misses out on some of his iconic ODI innings. The 200 against SA is just brushed upon in commentary. The 175 VS Australia is not even mentioned. Focus is more on tests and less on ODIs.
I bought an edition with some great personal photographs of Sachin.
The book also does provide some dressing room gossips that Indian general fan always looks forward to, but in just the subtle amount. Strong views on Chappel, the 194 declaration by Dravid, some of his ideals and some surprising cricketers Sachin respects... all of these provide little  treats to the reader.
While some might skim through pages, this book provides some great insight  as to how Sachin used to prepare against some bowlers. How he used to adjust during difficult times. What strategies he used to form. At times I felt, how come Sachin has just hundred 100s, he should be having about 200 centuries. And this might just be the material a teenager, wanting to make a career in cricket might find extremely useful.
There is humor in appropriate amount. And almost all varities of statistics possible. Whole scorecards have been included.
This would be an ideal book to gift to your son/sibling if he is thinking of a future in cricket as his career.
I give it 3.5 stars.
Autobiography :  is a written account of the life of a person written by that person.
There are good things and bad things. This book has become more fiction like rather an autobiography. There are only good things that he talks about and has remained netural all the other things that happened.
Read Sachin's autobiography written by Boria Majumdar in about 3 sitting. The first thought on completing the book was how conveniently some topics were removed or just touched briefly to avoid any controversy and how great the book was marketed so that each and everybody should go and read it. Sachin has systematically taken us ( the reader ) step by step from the childhood to retirement. The childhood memories were the best part of the book as it revealed somethings that many of us did not know. Also his great admiration and love for his family is well portrayed and stands in good light for those who follow Sachin - the Bharat Ratna.
  Overall the book is all about his journey in terms of how many runs he has scored in a match, how he tacked the best of the bowlers, how unlucky he was because of some umpire decisions went against him ( which could have been omitted a few times ) , what he ate after the matches. The book essentially lacks the insights, the dramas, the thought process, and his opinions on others. The book is all about 'my runs', 'my shots', 'my team' and 'my country'. We all love Sachin for what he has done for India and in true sense is a Bharat Ratna. Throughout a carrier of about 20+ years he has shown maturity, dignity and has been humble in all possible conditions he has been put too. But the book definitely lacks a punch; it is rather a a scorecard rather than personal journal.
A very descriptive autobiography by a very simple and humble man whom we all love and pray for..one who made every Indian forget their own problems for a moment at least .. a stop to whole nation..winning so many hurdles in life and on field..
Sachin is a immortal man and a hardworking caring person. India is his pride and honour. Cricket was his life for 21 years. Knows everything and is known by everyone related to cricket in any form
Sachin Tendulkar is a phenom that has made all sports grow better in India as well as many sports persons. He has filled in dreams  for the next generation through his own examples. He is just putting these and many unknown things about his life for everyone to be inspired to live and work for India as a true humble person.
Thanks Amazon for prompt service. Bought it for gifting a sachin fan. He was totally disappointed with it, and told "Better watch his innings". This autobiography is not up to expectations. Maybe a fan could write a far better biography for him.
It was an honour to read the story of Sachin Tendulkar...i was pretty excited when i started reading the book...
The book is overall good...but it feels like going through all the matches that tendulkar has played in his lifetime..
Its not waste of money...coz even a big sachin fan can miss out few things about sachin...while the book has lot of it...but the book doesn't actually inspires one..it gives the insight of sachin's life...
Still being a sachin fan i would always say....i loved the book...
as a sachin fan 95 % of the things written are know .
Well this is a story about God and his journey. Its fascinating and descriptive. I was simply amazed that Sachin remembers each and every match and also details. Book also covers a lot about Sachin's upbringing, family and his value system. I think for every cricket lover and Sachin fan its a MUST read book. Please also note that Sachin has not trashed or talked ill about anybody in the book so if you are looking to read some controversial information then this is certainly not a book for you!
This book as an auto biography is very  much  contrary  to  what  we think  about  Sachin. We know him  as a very humble  cricketer. But, after  reading  this  book, this  notion  is  blown  away. It  is  fully  about I, me and myself. It  is  very  difficult  to  digest  this  nature  of  Sachin.
In fact I am disappointed  and  disillusioned  to know  the  real Sachin.
From  now  on  I feel he was  a  great  cricketer. But  not  a great  team  player. Not  at  all.
I just loved it..he has won our hearts with his awesome performances throughout his career..and he is still doing the same thing even after his retirement..
Autobiographies by Indian players are very rare - we have had only one in the last twenty five years from Kapil Dev - so i  was expecting this to be a magnum opus - but it falls well short of expectation - only the sheer size and the brand name carries it through
This come out as more of a statistics and complete coverage of all the series Sachin has played and his dismissals- as ghosted by Boria M.But most of the autobiographies don't cover each and every series - usually the more prominent series are given more coverage.
There are some insights on his personal life , relationship with Anjali , his music likes etc and some thoughts on his personal battles and preparation for some key matches like Pakistan in 2003 and the Multan 2004 declaration- however what is missing is his thoughts on who were the best players he played against - who were the most difficult bowlers he  played against (apart from Cronje) - what would be his World XI  and of course some insights on the match fixing controversy.i would have wished this book to have focused more on Sachin's observations on techniques , some thoughts on his Indian team mates - what was his best Indian team etc and to be less obsessed with facts and figures.
I would refer to Ricky Ponting's book which had a lot of interesting snippets in boxes which would have embellished this long awaited book by Sachin.
Good Book to read it one time. However book is limited to descriptions of cricket matches Sachin played. His others features of personality left unnoticed.
after reading the 500 page book, my first feeling was 'sachin has written so little'. A sachin fan would have liked to know much more about sachin and his views on some critical topics. however reading the book is like revisiting the magic that sachin created all these years. it is a must read for all his fans. i am waiting for another book from the master himself, which will cover the portions left in this book. boria majumdar could have certainly done better in his narration. well,
The book got the response due to the cover photo. I guess you should read only if you are a Sachin fan. Infact it can be left even in that case also. Not very good writing style. Basically all the matches, tournaments he has played during his career have been explained along with scorecards.
I guess you should not buy a book for that. Speaking of the seller, I got it for really low price that the market rate. Amazon really surprises me with the prices in normal routine. Kudos.
This is more like an elaborate Wikipedia article on Sachin Tendulkar - neither a nuanced autobiography nor a great cricket book. There are even a number of proof-reading errors. Looks like a hastily prepared book. I am a Tendulkar fan. So no problem in keeping it as a memorabilia. Non-fans and those looking for serious cricket books or autobiographies may well leave this wide outswinger of a book. He has mastered the art of batting, but not the art of writing or story telling.
Being a Sachin's ardent fan I would like to buy this book at any cost(?) Not really, the discount given by amazon.com is really amazing and with no thought I ordered the book. It's worth reading. We easily criticize when a team loses, but the difficult times the players have to undergo is not known to many of them. Sachin has opened his heart and It is wonderful reading....
Haven't really expected much from this book. So much has already been written about Sachin.
I was rather expecting some rare and special photographs. But it was a disappointment. All the photographs are well seen.
Only one was special..the piece of paper Sachin used to write the names in his farewell speech!! This book has a nice photograph of that. :)
This is complete waste of time. I stopped reading it after 200 pages. It's like statsguru of cricinfo in a book filtered by Sachin. I expected so much more, I wanted to read his emotions, what he went through at the time of crisis like match fixing etc but nothing. I have seen sachin play from him first match and this book was like replay. Not recommended.
Well i am a huge sachin fan. But this book is not what i expected. Apart from some unknown incidents it doesnt provide much into tge life of God of Cricket. At the end i realised it was just a stats book. Not an autobiography.
And Amazon's service is way better then other online retailers. And that was the only thing i liked about the order.
The book is very descriptive. Maybe some people find it as less literature but it has all the description to how to be prepare as a sportsman more so over how to be a great human being. Sachin Tendulkar, The God as we know, din't hide when he sometime did behave wrongly. Every coach/parents read this book to prepare their children for the future.
The hardships which had Sachin had gone through in his childhood and the way he tackled them with his determination and willpower are a source of inspiration for all the youngsters. His humility and the love for all his relatives and well wishers are portrayed in the book in a very lucid manner. This book is truly a treasure to possess!!
Beautiful. Lot of things to know about. It goes from HHS childhood. Nice book. More of his stats and scores. Still nice to know how he grew and few things about the Indian cricket. How the pressure on the cricketers, etc. if you a fan of Sachin, then you'll buy and go for it. It's always good to know the one who you worshiped by himself.
Most of what is written in the book is about matches and scores that has already been printed. Was expecting to know more of his inner struggles and inner dialogues of the champion. They should have contrubuted equally to his outer struggles. Was very much disappointed to see only a small para describing the first obe day double century.
An excellent account of Sachin's cricketing career and that of what Indian cricket was in those 24+ years with some glimpses of Sachin's personal and family life. This is the best gift of 2014 for many cricket lovers all over the world and most certainly for me. Thanks Amazon for allowing me to receive it in a such an easy way.
I gifted the book to my boyfriend who is a huge fan of Sachin Tendulkar. I remember how emotional he got listening to Sachin's farewell speech. He loved this gift from me. Excellent gift for Sachin fan :) I am yet to read the book. Waiting for him to finish.
Every house need to have this book and each youth/child should read it. "The beauty of pureness", "effects of parents eth;ics on a child","to growup well  children's childhood matters the most", etc. You get to know from this book
I am a huge fan of Sachin and this is why its my first buy in book category of my life and i am fully satisfied with it. Just one flaw that its cover have to be protected which may become dirty because of it white color. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.
I cried when he announced 200 will be his last.
I cried when he entered Wankhede for one last time with Indian cricket jersey.
I cried whenever I saw his glimpse on TV.
I cried when he scored his last runs for India.
I cried when he gave hell of emotional speech.
He made my childhood days awesome.
I am proud I watched # cricketto see his bat only.
Now I am crying as that child has died on this day, last year.
I will cry again remembering those unforgettable memories.
This book showcases Tendulkar's razor sharp memory but nothing much beyond it. Its a plain narrative of his entire career right from early childhood days.. not much insights into his psyche or how Indian Cricket is managed, the politics around it etc.
Great book. But again, Sachin has kept it very very professional with not many juicy bits. But indeed great to know in detail on how much Sachin struggled everyday to be the master he is. One time read but definitely a collector's treasure.
his autobiography contains the content which we all generally know through media barring few photos. Nothing interesting or any more insights into the dressing room chats, controversies and their discussions etc, hence making it an OK read.
Not what I expected from an autobiography. This seems to be just a chronological summary of Sachin's playing career without any soul in it - it just goes on to say "this happened, then this happened, then this happened". I don't mind that he skipped the match fixing and spot fixing controversies, but then there is nothing in terms of how the team was built, what was the team mindset in Australia '02 - '03, or Kolkata '01... there seems to be no feeling in what has been written. To be fair, there are some poignant passages - like WC'99 when Sachin's father died and the Kenya match after that when he go 140*, or when Dravid declared in Multan with him on 194* or his epic 241* in Sydney, but there are few and far in between.
Compared to something like Agassi's autobiography, this makes for very bland reading. It's just like the man himself, totally non controversial. Maybe my expectations were high but in all fairness, what a cricinfo.com editor like Sid Vaidyanathan or Sid Monga writes about cricket impacts me more than this book did.
Its is an easy book  to read. More enjoyable by cricket fans who can relive their memories of watching sachin batting. However it does feel underwhelming for those expecting a detailed analysis of state of cricket during the last 25 years.
Reads like a text. Plain and simple, to the extent of being labelled as boring! Sachin doesn't share his insights about the game, and his thoughts on critical issues like match-fixing. May be he played the game just for its enjoyment, and made a shield wall around himself and avoided all other thoughts.
excellent. a true portrayal of  Sachin's personal and professional life.
made a very pleasant reading..simple and lucid presentation.
on page 7 at the last para, Dreaming of a bicycle, it is "a" instead of" I".
Thanks Sachin for a wonderful book and to make or life more beautiful . You are an inspiration to all of us and this book just ignites the spark more strongly . Dear viewers if you read this book it is going to be a lifetime experience
The story telling is honestly not that great but it's Sachins story so its gotta be worth reading! Its like going to Kashmir and taking a picture, it doesn't matte how (not) skilled the photographer is, it's going to be an amazing one.
This is a must read.  Started reading it and could not stop before it finished.  An isight to Sachin's life.  Some of the controvorsies were not discussed which leaves viewers wanting for just a bit  more.  All in ll a great reading.
Expected more intense and less crib from sachin. Disappointed
Nothing much to say about this book, received ok, but there was no lamination-seal on the book (my colleague got a laminated sealed copy of the book from Amazon), first I thought it is a used one. But overall I am satisfied.
Readable for a cricket lover who has grown along and followed Sachin's career.... Not much of Masala.... There are so many secrets in cricket but he has skirted around them.... A gentleman's book !!! Readable but not HOT !!!
Its a great book. Generally, autobiographies are full of self appraisals but this book is mostly the true account of Sachin's life. Amazon's packaging and delivery is great as always. Worth reading for all reading lovers.
Awesome book by Sachin sir.
The perfect story wid every chapter he touched our hearts wid his life story and we know from this that how he became the god of cricket wid dedication and hard work.
Hats off to u.
It is just awesome...... This man was under scanner for whole career and still has so much to say..... no controversies.... it's written in a dignified way..... hats off The master...... it's not just a book, it's as precious as geeta/bible/quran for cricket lovers.......:-) :-)
The service of the amezon is good but i have not like the case of the product the sticker of the book is getting loose at the first time  when i have broke the sealm of the packege
Nice book as a fan brought and studied...
Felt happy not only happy extreme happy...feeling proud of him and proud to be his name from my childhood and wanna continue forever
I really liked the way it's been written... got to know about Sachin Tendulkar personal side which is unknown and it's really heart-touching to know his struggles and hard work...
The book contains the fact that most of us already know. Missed the charm most autobiographies have.
5-stars for Amazon for delivering the product within a single day.
It was nice to read the book & to know a few issues which were not known . Thanks to Sachin for giving us a few hints, what are
happening in Cricket in India & in the World.
WE LOVE YOU SACHIN......EVERY TIME WE TURN ON THE TV TO WATCH A CRICKET MATCH WE ALL WISH THAT ITS YOU WHO IS COMING TO BAT WITH THAT MRF BAT AND ENTERTAIN US ALL......MISS U
I M DIE HEAD FAN OF SACHIN TENDULKAR'S BATTING
BOOK IS VERY GOOD FOR SACHINS FANS ITS MASTER STROKE
GO FOR IT
SPECIAL REPUBLIC DAY OFFER
DONT MISS IT
I have bought it on COD basis and received in excellent condition. The price in book stall is 899 and i got it in 476 only which is more than 50%. What more can expect.
Its a good book for cricket lovers. You can feel the sentiments going through a player's mind on and off the cricket field. Only flaw is use of too many statistics.
interesting book. the time of ordering it was showing delivery will be in 4 working days but i got it the next day itself. the packing was very good and safe too...
Should have been more informative and should have contained incidents that were not in public domain earlier. Whatever is there are already known to the readers. Disappointing. NAM BARE DARSHAN CHOTE.
the much anticipated book included more of stats which are better available on cricinfo.
would have been better if god of cricket would have shared some more incidents  of his cricketing career
Amazon delivery is good. received before delivery date..
About Book, As lik many am also a Hardcore fan of sachin I love the book.  Chance to know about his personal feel as a crickter.
Enjoyed reading the book...cricket, cricket & cricket...very well written....could have been more interesting if other items like dressing room chats, in field banters etc. were also included...
I expected more from Sachin in his autobiography. Very disappointed since he hasnt shared much on how he thinks, strategizes the game. He has also avoided the match-fixing saga of the late 90s.
Words straight from Gods mouth......we all know about his cricket it would have been good had he written more about his personal views on the issues related to cricket like match fixing....
The book provides a wonderful insight into all those little details which would been overshadowed in the scheme of larger things....absolute joy to read and very friendly language used too
not as expected, I am very disappointed with the book.
Content and some cricket  moments can keep you busy but the pattern of writing is not as expected, could have been better.
A must read for a Sachin fan; No startling revelations; One thing that struck me was the amount of injuries he had to deal with over the course of his career. Hats off to his passion!
Amazing!!!!!
I think every Indian must read it. I am writing this review after completion of 25% of the book. I am reading slowly because I really dont want to finish it.
The journey of the sport's biggest and nation's greatest cricketing hero from his initial days to being a BHARAT RATNA recipient. Needless to say.....AWE-INSPIRING
It's best book about sachin's life..its contain all about sachin exclusive pictures, family photos etc..if you can buy must buy this...also its inspirational book
No fault with the book or the quality but the packaging needs to be modified I suppose. Despite of having such a hard cover, all the corners are bent inwards.
Sachin is worth to be praised on field but reading his point of view on Yuvraj in world cup 2011 was complete disappointment. A man with a big "I".
Disappointed... maybe due to unrealistic expectation..most of the things said in the book are common knowledge. No revelations. Just statements and facts.
Playing it My way is a simple and sweet writing of @SRT, its just like watching his batting without any disturbance. Thank you SRT for this presentation
One can get lot of inspiration, motivation out of this awesome book. My respectful pranam to this great son of Mother India. ...Sachin Tendulkar.
Its an average book. Could not met upto my expectations as most of the info looks as if its a copy paste from a news paper or a cricket database.
Very well written!! The god himself describes his life with full grace!! His passion for the sport is beyond reach of anyone's
imagination!!
Its good but not as much revealing as one would expect from an autobiography . Its merely a gratitude towards his fan and fraternity in general.
It's give me to close view about sachin life. it's a really good to know the secrete thing in sachin life.His passion about game as a team player, as a supportive senior , friendship , people expectation and much more.. I love this book. Thanks Sachin for this great gift to your love-once.
WE LOVE YOU SACHIN......
WONDERFUL BOOK.....
EVERY TIME WE TURN ON THE TV TO WATCH A CRICKET MATCH WE ALL WISH THAT ITS YOU WHO IS COMING TO BAT WITH THAT ADIDAS BAT AND ENTERTAIN US ALL......MISS U
 Dear viewers if you read this book it is going to be a lifetime experience
Never expected something humorous from a sports legend. Credits to Boria Majmudar for narrating it in a way that excites a common man. It gives access to Sachin's personal life which he always given shield and privacy. Even if you are not a vivid reader of books, it will be easy to go on.
Though am a die hard fan of sachin, but his autobiography left me quite disappointed. It failed to provide the insights into cricket and his personal life that a reader would look forward to. Most of it contained the information that a person who follows Sachin and cricket already knows.
An insight into the enviable journey travelled by the Cricket God, through his own words. A must to read and have book not only for all Sachin's fans but also for all true Indian cricket lovers because, Sachin's Biography and Indian Cricket History, during his period are the same.
Is there any necessity to write anything on this book? It's a treasure. Price is reasonable but what about for those who can't afford to buy it. I happened to visit my native village and donated the book to the village library. The youngsters treated this book just as a Holy Book.
Honestly, i didnt thought it would make me curious, smile, laugh and emotional while reading it. But this book has got all the ingredients. There are many short stories about his confrontrations with opponents which would held you on your seats and will make you owe later.
Well drafted autobiography. ST could have discussed more about the present/future crop of players. Surprised not much has been mentioned about Dhoni, one of our most successful captians in all forms of Cricket. Book packaging and delivery very well handled by Amazon.
The life story of a Superhuman. Has been my idol since childhood. But still there were certain lovely secrets, of which we all knew nothing. The potrayal of a life so special... which inspired billions. Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. A must read for one and all.
A book which is riding on the popularity of the name! And, of course, on the press hype. Little in substance.
The book did not live upto the expectations. He has avoided most of the controversies which rocked world cricket during his time.
The book just focuses on Indian victories and how Sachin played his part in those.
One of the disappointing innings by Sachin... Not much insight..  I played this tour on this day... We played well/badly.. We won/lost the match... This is how the book goes... Cricinfo's timeline does a better job..
It was a good read. Being a Sachin fan I never knew he had to battle some injuries or the other throughout his long career. You would get an insight about how  great sportsman live their lives after reading this book
Must read for any individual. People only see the successful  face and not the effort behind that success. It's not about Tendulkar's success, it's about all people who supported and helped him cultivate his talent.
Sachin was always my hero and still he is my idol.Whatever he does he always carry some sort of good information for our society.i cud not control my tears when he was delivering his farewell speech .he is an icon.
Interesting book but very lengthy should have been short
The book is good. We can read a single time. It shows us how dedicated he is, hardships he has faced as a cricketer.
He is a true Inspiration to Younger ones who wants to get into the field of Cricket.
Being a hardcore Sachin fan this book is awesome for me. Loved it!
A small suggestion - Buy this book only if you are a cricket fan or else you'll feel it boring after half of the book is over.
Had a lot of expection from the book. Expected Sachin to elaborate more on match fixing scandal, Greg chapel era and also on how he prepared for matches instead of writing about what happened in matches.
Loved the book as I got to know a lot about the Wizard of cricket himself, enjoyed reading many anecdotes and life of great Cricket legend. This book is for Sachin lovers and not necessarily book lovers.
You get to know out of scene moments of major incidents happened n indian cricket. Also ull know more about sachins personel and childhood life.
Poorly written bio, disappointing from a man of his caliber. Very few personal insights, more a recollection of scoreboards, injuries and food.
Its interesting to read master blasters childhood and how he trained to get to top.. its not a life story type but the incidents and experiance
Excellent book for true sachin's fan because it contains whole story about his life n describe all the matches he played in his 24 year career
Decent read. Book was silent on sachin's inherent motivation of scoring runs on all terrain...
Indeed he is " Bharat Ratna"
leaves a tear drop in the eye of every cricket fan! the mammoth size is justified by the 24 year long marvelous career! the work of a genius!
simple, honest and descriptive. One may find Autobiographies to be boring but grab this edition of the legend and I bet you cant put it down.
Good read for Sachin Fans. Deliberately seems to have ignored match fixing controversy and his review of bowlers and batsmen during his time.
Book is awesome like Sachin. I'm still in middle of da book nd enjoying a lot. Thanks to sachin for sharing his story..............brilliant.
May not be a literary gem, but it's an honest book from the gentleman of the game. Could replace the book of history of cricket, undoubtedly.
Brilliant book by the Little Master. It felt as if Sachin himself is in front of me and telling his life's story. Very nice book.
Good...could have been better...but am glad that GOD himself incarnated and penned down some(not all) of his hidden treasures!!!
Amazing Book. Great efforts put on by all the persons to make it successful. Easy read and attention grabbing events. Thank You.
From Amazon perspective, it was delivered on time. The book is worth a read for anybody inIndia who loves cricket and Sachin.
The book is great. All credit goes to Sachin not to you guys. Your delivery was pathetic. The delivery was delayed by 4 days.
Honesty Is The Name Of The God Of The Cricket ....... Every Cricketeer Should Must Read It....
I Recomended For Everyone
The experience go through the life with GOD of cricket the narration is simply superb it is the bible for SACHIN lovers. . .
Amazing service by amazon.
I thoroughly enjoyed the book .
His way of the play , is an inspiration .
Absolutely amazing! Don't hesitate, its that man! this book is from his heart! go get a copy! #ThankYouSachin once more! and prompt delivery by amazon! the book was released on 6th and I received it on 8th at around 1 pm.
Nice quality, immediate delivery, packing a bit uneven, but no damage to the book.....nice experience....Fully satisfied!
A must kept book for Sachin's fan. Gives a first hand exp of his journey from a lanky boy to the Masterblaster slong with some amazing pics.
On time delivery.  I am very happy
The book arrived before time and in great condition. it is a pleasant read!! and a perfect gift for a cricket lover and a sachin die hard!
Superb book, well written by Sachin and Mujumdar. I could really correlate the lifestyle Sachin lived till his teens with every Mumbaikar.
Its okey, not nail biting and very interesting.i brought for Mr Tendulkar and am a die hard fan of The masterblaster.
Salute you sir
GOOD ,but I had expected a signed copy which I did not receive.
THERE WAS NO HARD COVER EITHER.
Appreciate the timely delivery.
Sachin played with his heart and so has he done with the pen in his hand this time. This book is one of the finest work. The words have come out as straight as his drives. Right from the heart of the man with a heart of gold. It is simple yet intriguing. What makes this book stand out is the fact that this comes from the man who has seldom spoken publicly on what goes in his life. A life which every Indian was part of in one way or the other. They wanted to hear what their hero had to say. This book is a salute to anyone and everyone who has been his fan and more for those who have not liked him for whatever reasons. Tendulkar being Tendulkar has once again delivered to the expectation of a billion people.
"Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked in and off the 22 yard belt for 22 years"
For them who could not see this man conduct himself in and off the field and get inspired, this book should serve the purpose.
The book is below expectations. It is more of a stats book than biography. Espncricinfo articles are far better than this. Disappointed!
Inspiring book for one and all. Especially, the Engish used is simple and clear and thus making it easy to comprehend by all age groups.
It's a very good book, which gives an insight look in the life of the world's greatest batsman. The book keeps you engaged till the end.
Its a very inspiring book. It talks about many incidences which were otherwise unknown. Really enjoyed reading it. Hooked till the end.
A must read for all Sachin (cricketer and person) fans!
Could have been better by including instances from Sachin's personal life.
What Can I say about this book.!! The name it self suggests. Quality wise this is good book. I will keep it with me for a memories..!!
Its entire Life sketched on paper!!
Really awesome, very Inspiring and teaches how positive approach leads one to success!
THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.
SACHIN HATS OFF FOR THIS BIOGRAPHY.
HAD TEARS WHEN READING SOME EMOTIONAL RETIREMENT EVENTS
Brilliant book. If you are a cricket fan, you will love this book. Sachin has wrote this book from his heart and it contains the inside story of Indian dressing room too. He has touched all controversies. I can write a book while reviewing this book. It is the first english book which I have bought and reading with so much interest. It is a book I will keep throughout my life with me.
Thank you so much amazon for making the start of this sunday so awesome!!
Like every cricket crazy Indian, pre ordered it and got it today. Time to revisit childhood. Must buy everyone. For those who do not love cricket.. U must read this... U'll definetly fall for it.
presented beautifully.
The expectations of a proud INDIAN is always high from a man of his stature. I expected more from him .
An uninteresting account of an otherwise exciting career!
Sachin should have chosen a better writer to pen his autobiography.
Thank you, Sachin!
You will rewind your old cricket viewing experience through each page.
Very prompt delivery by Amazon
The autobiography of living god, you will real feel great while reading. God has opened every aspect of  his life.... :)
What do I write about life of God!!!
So the content is great only..  and so is the book quality and amazon service!
love it... this is so motivating !!
More than a cricketer he is one of the best human being alive in this world!!!
he is silent on so many crucial issues importantly regarding match fixing nd drs. a man of his stature needs to open up
SRT - wish you would have played some more years to give us more excitements on field & later translate into books ..
If u are Indian , if u are cricket fan, if u know English.
And if any of the above u fit in, this book is must!
Fantastic book! Even my wife, not a lover of cricket, fully read it without dropping. Sachin's honesty is exemplary.
The book is real inspiration and full of truth about Sachin's play. Every follower of Sachin should read this book.
I am impressed with the service. Good. I will keep buy books and other things in Amazon as it meets my expectation.
Amazing read! And you will feel Sachin , ie his humbleness in the entire book. Masterpiece from the little master!
A good stuff with lot of excitement n fun..n also there is many unknown things which really make it worthful buy..
St wrote superb. .. whenever I started to read it den I will not like to leave the vook until it will be finished
Fantastic read in terms of what makes the man Sachin Tendulkar a great idol and brans ambassador as a Sportsman.
The man who cricket loved back.... Amazing, inspirational... Ramayan, Bible, Khurran and Playing It My Way......
it's a very interesting, nice and great book. It contains many details about Sachin Tendulkar my favorite player
This Book is a must for all Sachin Fans. It's a collectors item. You can say, this is THE HOLY BOOK of Cricket.
Book realeased on November 6th and I had it in my hands on 7th November.
Perfect way to settle my weekend.
What a brilliant player and now what a philosophy of words painted for him.
Gr8 experience. I loved it !!
Book Is Too Good. Even Pages Are Around 500 Still Book Weight Is Less. Pages Quality Also Beyond Expectations.
Must read for a Sachin fan. I don't think people who don't like following cricket would appreciate this book.
It was an OK book. I was expecting an insight into his life whereas the book takes the reader to various incidents/ experiences and leaves it to the reader to form his opinion . Of course , very readable and simply presented
I am an ardent fan of Tendulkar and all through his cricketing years i used to be a vocal supporter and die-hard fan. In fact I have stopped watching cricket when he has retired. Now cricket is boring thing for me. I have bought this book with great expectations and I must say I am deeply disappointed. I cannot digest Sachin finding fault with Dravid for declaring the innings in Multan, Pakistan because he cannot get his double hundred. When I bought the book I did not expect it to be mystery thriller or page turner. But this book is a real bore. Only snippets here and there were interesting. Only the high regard for Sachin made me to buy this book.
Finished going through every pages of my Holy Book Playing it My Way the Autobiography of my God. The respect, Love, Devotion i had for him is just multiplied by infinite. Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of reading for the first time ever in my life, it took only 2 day's and night for me to complete the book of nearly 480 pages.
Top three phases of book I liked is:
1. When Sachin woke up in a middle of his surgery in April 2003. Went under knife on his left hand ring finger due to a calcification, he was so worried surgery will be made on his palm and the will force him to change the way he grips the bat.
I bought it for my husband who is a diehard Sachin fan...he not only follows his cricketing style but also adores him as the man himself off the field, his ideologies.I thought this book will have enough of the later one so pre-booked and gifted him...But While I started reading it I could just find that other than few small stories here and there Sachin has not really opened up himself  in this book to every situation;he has not stated how he thought,what was his reaction,thought process etc...It is true that he is such a talked about figure that nothing was unknown about him but wanted to see all these hard work,success,humility,honesty from his perspective....I felt that this book lacks that..other than few unknown stories (Anjali chapter, may be a little of Greg Chappel story(this hardly would be 10 liners)) it seemed to me like a match report summary of his entire carrier...Sachin fans please excuse me..but I stand by what I said... Thanks!!
It was an honour to read the story of Sachin Tendulkar...i was pretty excited when i started reading the book...
The book is overall good...but it feels like going through all the matches that tendulkar has played in his lifetime..
Its not waste of money...coz even a big sachin fan can miss out few things about sachin...while the book has lot of it...but the book doesn't actually inspires one..it gives the insight of sachin's life...
Still being a sachin fan i would always say....i loved the book...
as a sachin fan 95 % of the things written are know .
Well this is a story about God and his journey. Its fascinating and descriptive. I was simply amazed that Sachin remembers each and every match and also details. Book also covers a lot about Sachin's upbringing, family and his value system. I think for every cricket lover and Sachin fan its a MUST read book. Please also note that Sachin has not trashed or talked ill about anybody in the book so if you are looking to read some controversial information then this is certainly not a book for you!
This book as an auto biography is very  much  contrary  to  what  we think  about  Sachin. We know him  as a very humble  cricketer. But, after  reading  this  book, this  notion  is  blown  away. It  is  fully  about I, me and myself. It  is  very  difficult  to  digest  this  nature  of  Sachin.
In fact I am disappointed  and  disillusioned  to know  the  real Sachin.
From  now  on  I feel he was  a  great  cricketer. But  not  a great  team  player. Not  at  all.
I just loved it..he has won our hearts with his awesome performances throughout his career..and he is still doing the same thing even after his retirement..
Autobiographies by Indian players are very rare - we have had only one in the last twenty five years from Kapil Dev - so i  was expecting this to be a magnum opus - but it falls well short of expectation - only the sheer size and the brand name carries it through
This come out as more of a statistics and complete coverage of all the series Sachin has played and his dismissals- as ghosted by Boria M.But most of the autobiographies don't cover each and every series - usually the more prominent series are given more coverage.
There are some insights on his personal life , relationship with Anjali , his music likes etc and some thoughts on his personal battles and preparation for some key matches like Pakistan in 2003 and the Multan 2004 declaration- however what is missing is his thoughts on who were the best players he played against - who were the most difficult bowlers he  played against (apart from Cronje) - what would be his World XI  and of course some insights on the match fixing controversy.i would have wished this book to have focused more on Sachin's observations on techniques , some thoughts on his Indian team mates - what was his best Indian team etc and to be less obsessed with facts and figures.
I would refer to Ricky Ponting's book which had a lot of interesting snippets in boxes which would have embellished this long awaited book by Sachin.
Good Book to read it one time. However book is limited to descriptions of cricket matches Sachin played. His others features of personality left unnoticed.
after reading the 500 page book, my first feeling was 'sachin has written so little'. A sachin fan would have liked to know much more about sachin and his views on some critical topics. however reading the book is like revisiting the magic that sachin created all these years. it is a must read for all his fans. i am waiting for another book from the master himself, which will cover the portions left in this book. boria majumdar could have certainly done better in his narration. well,
The book got the response due to the cover photo. I guess you should read only if you are a Sachin fan. Infact it can be left even in that case also. Not very good writing style. Basically all the matches, tournaments he has played during his career have been explained along with scorecards.
I guess you should not buy a book for that. Speaking of the seller, I got it for really low price that the market rate. Amazon really surprises me with the prices in normal routine. Kudos.
This is more like an elaborate Wikipedia article on Sachin Tendulkar - neither a nuanced autobiography nor a great cricket book. There are even a number of proof-reading errors. Looks like a hastily prepared book. I am a Tendulkar fan. So no problem in keeping it as a memorabilia. Non-fans and those looking for serious cricket books or autobiographies may well leave this wide outswinger of a book. He has mastered the art of batting, but not the art of writing or story telling.
It not merely out of loyalty that I give this book 5 stars, it really is a worthy read for anyone who has followed him and also very young generation who want to understand why he has a special place in our hearts... Him talking about his favourite series which ironically turns out to be the one where he bowled wonderfully in the last match, and world cup 2003 with the trials and tribulations of nervousness and dehydration and real exhaustion and still finding the strength to carry on... I hoped he would talk about the 98 against Pakistan and he did, and I dont think he realises how inspiring it is to hear his anecdotal reference to the preparation before the next match, for him its probably just an embarrassingly funny story... but as a reader I felt ashamed of how laid-back I am about my passions.
The chapter on his wife and marriage is kind of the stuff romantic movies are made of, pretty sure some filmmaker will realise it soon.. anyway, it seems I can ramble on about this... in a nutshell, its wonderful book... yeah there is no scandoloud expose about matchfixing, but I knew that even before I read it, cause you know him, Its just not his way ;)
This is my first review here and I am so glad its for a book he wrote
The book as such reads like a Journal - mostly a running commentary of matches (although important, key matches) which gets monotonous after a while. That is something, since all the matches mentioned are the milestone matches in Sachin's career and for any fan of Indian cricket, that holds considerable interest.
Sachin's relations within his family, especially with his kids, with teammates, and the food he had during his tours, besides personal anecdotes from some of the matches are broadly the highlights of the book. Also,finer points of his playing technique are mentioned here and there, which would be of interest to the keen follower of the game.
The part of the book that lets you down is its non-controversial stand on most issues. Match fixing is mentioned only in passing, barely a few pages are dedicated to the Monkeygate scandal. BCCI is held up in high esteem almost everywhere. Most surprisingly, Yuvraj Singh's struggle with cancer and Sachin's stint with the Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member do not find a mention in this book.
It is still worth buying and reading, because it is Sachin after all. The pictures generously sprinkled within the book are a collector's delight. What strikes one throughout the book is the straightforward, uncomplicated approach that Sachin seems to have towards his life. That alongwith the devotion towards family, the patriotism and the attention to the minutest details of the sport are the key impressions one could treasure, as we complete this book.
Being a vivid Sachin fan I expected more of thought process and behind the screens happenings in the game and in the dressing room. But this book is disappointment on this front. This book is more of various essays about all his innings put together.
Even after reading the book you wont get a feeling that you know Sachin more than before reading it.
I am a big fan of Sachin. Got this book thinking will get to see it from the masters point of view. Have to say that I was disappointed. Pretty much what was in the newspaper and various columns were all collected and logically arranged.
If you are fan and feel that you need to have a copy of this for your collection, then buy it otherwise you can give it a pass.
When you follow a sports personality and the game passionately for so long, you'd expect the life story to be equally riveting. This books while good and informative falls short of being great. It seems rather superficial and gives you nothing but a bit more than what is already known about the man. It doesn't help that there are pages and pages of statistics which seem to be there for the sole purpose of filling up pages.
It would've been nice to have some personal views from the man on things like the match fixing scandal and his views of Azharuddin and Jadeja getting caught in the storm, his relationship with Vinod Kambli or even more anectodes if being on tour. Maybe, like with his batting we come to expect too much from him...
The first thing I saw and liked about the book is its photographs. The book has a nice collection of pictures from Sachin's playing career. He brings to life the old test matches of the late 90's  which many people of my age started watching cricket with. His criticisms of the people around him are very subtle but if recognised, one is sure to have a good laugh at them. The tone of his writing, as expected is very idealistic(which is very typical to Sachin Tendulkar) but likeable for a fan like me. If the reader is not a great fan, he/she might not like this as much.
The book is an above average read. If you are a fan, you will like this in your collection. However, if you are not, this might not be liked a lot.
There's nothing in it which we don't know. Rather than describing his hardships and mental make-up for the game, the book just feels like a scorecard and summary of every series he played. If you are not a cricket fan, you should stay away from this and if you are one, then too you will be disappointed with this.
Very poor writing (almost high school standards), and hardly any personal insights. The book reads like a paraphrasing of scorecards from the past. A safe and rather bland offering from which, I would strongly recommend, any bibliophile stay miles away.
In last 20 odd years, I loved reading anything written on Sachin and was hoping for great insight about this man. Honestly, it was bit disappointing except for first few chapters and last few chapters. I felt like some of the contents were rushed through in hurry. Though I'm not dissapointed by Sachin himself, but certainly Author has done poor job in extracting best out of Sachin and articulating in rather insightful way. Perhaps, it would have been good idea to write multiple volumes rather than rushing through all in one shot. No matter what, my admiration for Sachin will be same forever.
Finished reading the book " Playing It My Way" an autobiography of Sachin Tendulkar. For those in search of any sensational revelations in the book, it is a a disappointment. Nobody expects from a person who has steered clear of any controversy during his playing days, to create any sort of controversy at this stage. Though a major portion of the book just appears as statement of facts, hence repetition of what is already universally known , the author should not be blamed for that because the events surrounding Tendulkar ,on and off the field, have unfolded before us in the last 25 years or so. In the narrative, there are many instances of mind games played and strategies adopted to outwit the opposition which makes up for very interesting reading. A disappointing aspect in the book, however is that the author has not devoted much space to some of his great contemporaries. No mention is made about Kapil Dev's final appearance in test cricket though Sachin was a member of the team at that time. More surprisingly, some of the gem of innings played by Rahul Dravid hardly gets mentioned.Though Rahul and Sachin partnered in Test maches in 143 innings, and scored 6905 runs as partners with 20 century and 29 half century partnerships,it is surprising that Rahul's achievements and his contribution to Indian cricket has not found any place in the book. In this respect, Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S.Laxman should consider themselves slightly better off.
To sum up, much more was expected from Sachin Tendulkar,not only about himself, but also for his insights about those greats who played along with him and against him.
This is an autibiography that would appeal to the diehard sachin fans. For me personally, it was a nostalgic read , reliving all his matches with some interesting titbits here and there. But for someone who hasn't followed his career so closely or someone who is cricket neutral , an endless grind of all his matches awaits you!
Great insights into the mind of one of the best batsman of the world. Some of the instances on how he interprets the ball before it is delivered talks volumes about the ability of this individual. Ideal only for people who have followed Indian cricket over years. The last part i.e. his retirement speech still gives goosebumps.
Great read... If u r an avid cricket fan then u can relate to the tournaments Sachin mentions... If u don't follow cricket closely u will still enjoy learning about the game. We often feel that Sachin is an effortless player but this book shows the immense hardwork he has put in and how consciously Sachin tries to be grounded
Like every one I also hoped the best from him.But it was not like an autobiography but can tell it as match to match statistics.Because it is really not an autobiography as written by Boria Mazumdar and Sachin has given him interviews.But it is not bad to buy it.Some recalls from Sachin about his life are worth to know....
I bought the autobiography with a lot of expectations and none were fulfilled - not written interestingly enough and not much insight into what was happening in his mind and in the cricket field. The silence on the match fixing controversy which affected so many of his colleagues is very disappointing. Overall a poor buy
Really very nice and wonderful one all the experience has place in reality way. It is extrimly difficult to place the cricket experience in form of book.
Really a great player our god of cricket and master blaster and little master.
SACHIN TENDULKAR SIR.
Regrads

Its an Awesome Book for Sachin Fans Specially when you take him as your God. And yes for non Sachin fans too its a wonderful book to read some real life fact files of the super human. Does not let you down. And yes if you have Sachin fans who don't buy the book gift them one as i did. Gives greater Joy.
It's hard to believe the way sachin handled everything at such a big stage for so long.....to predict the next  delivery even before the bowler has started his runup, shows his greatness!!!!!
Surely the content justifies the title of the book....What
 a man..... Sorry..... "SUPERMAN"
Amazing book with amazing illustrations. Brings back memories of childhood and eager waiting of master blaster to come on pitch. The alacrity with which Sachin has faced so many injuries and still served nation through cricket is totally inspiring. Respect aa hi jata hai bande ke liye... Sab padh ke.
He s a champ,the book has its mettle in proving that,but yes ,would have been happier if I would get to know more about his personal life other than cricket.....anyway I can understand he is not a writer by profession..this man is worth a salute,good read to reassure that anything can be achieved!!
It not merely out of loyalty that I give this book 5 stars, it really is a worthy read for anyone who has followed him and also very young generation who want to understand why he has a special place in our hearts... Him talking about his favourite series which ironically turns out to be the one where he bowled wonderfully in the last match, and world cup 2003 with the trials and tribulations of nervousness and dehydration and real exhaustion and still finding the strength to carry on... I hoped he would talk about the 98 against Pakistan and he did, and I dont think he realises how inspiring it is to hear his anecdotal reference to the preparation before the next match, for him its probably just an embarrassingly funny story... but as a reader I felt ashamed of how laid-back I am about my passions.
The chapter on his wife and marriage is kind of the stuff romantic movies are made of, pretty sure some filmmaker will realise it soon.. anyway, it seems I can ramble on about this... in a nutshell, its wonderful book... yeah there is no scandoloud expose about matchfixing, but I knew that even before I read it, cause you know him, Its just not his way ;)
This is my first review here and I am so glad its for a book he wrote
The book as such reads like a Journal - mostly a running commentary of matches (although important, key matches) which gets monotonous after a while. That is something, since all the matches mentioned are the milestone matches in Sachin's career and for any fan of Indian cricket, that holds considerable interest.
Sachin's relations within his family, especially with his kids, with teammates, and the food he had during his tours, besides personal anecdotes from some of the matches are broadly the highlights of the book. Also,finer points of his playing technique are mentioned here and there, which would be of interest to the keen follower of the game.
The part of the book that lets you down is its non-controversial stand on most issues. Match fixing is mentioned only in passing, barely a few pages are dedicated to the Monkeygate scandal. BCCI is held up in high esteem almost everywhere. Most surprisingly, Yuvraj Singh's struggle with cancer and Sachin's stint with the Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member do not find a mention in this book.
It is still worth buying and reading, because it is Sachin after all. The pictures generously sprinkled within the book are a collector's delight.

Being a Sachin's ardent fan I would like to buy this book at any cost(?) Not really, the discount given by amazon.com is really amazing and with no thought I ordered the book. It's worth reading. We easily criticize when a team loses, but the difficult times the players have to undergo is not known to many of them. Sachin has opened his heart and It is wonderful reading....
Haven't really expected much from this book. So much has already been written about Sachin.
I was rather expecting some rare and special photographs. But it was a disappointment. All the photographs are well seen.
Only one was special..the piece of paper Sachin used to write the names in his farewell speech!! This book has a nice photograph of that. :)
This is complete waste of time. I stopped reading it after 200 pages. It's like statsguru of cricinfo in a book filtered by Sachin. I expected so much more, I wanted to read his emotions, what he went through at the time of crisis like match fixing etc but nothing. I have seen sachin play from him first match and this book was like replay. Not recommended.
Well i am a huge sachin fan. But this book is not what i expected. Apart from some unknown incidents it doesnt provide much into tge life of God of Cricket. At the end i realised it was just a stats book. Not an autobiography.
And Amazon's service is way better then other online retailers. And that was the only thing i liked about the order.
The book is very descriptive. Maybe some people find it as less literature but it has all the description to how to be prepare as a sportsman more so over how to be a great human being. Sachin Tendulkar, The God as we know, din't hide when he sometime did behave wrongly. Every coach/parents read this book to prepare their children for the future.
The hardships which had Sachin had gone through in his childhood and the way he tackled them with his determination and willpower are a source of inspiration for all the youngsters. His humility and the love for all his relatives and well wishers are portrayed in the book in a very lucid manner. This book is truly a treasure to possess!!
Beautiful. Lot of things to know about. It goes from HHS childhood. Nice book. More of his stats and scores. Still nice to know how he grew and few things about the Indian cricket. How the pressure on the cricketers, etc. if you a fan of Sachin, then you'll buy and go for it. It's always good to know the one who you worshiped by himself.
Most of what is written in the book is about matches and scores that has already been printed. Was expecting to know more of his inner struggles and inner dialogues of the champion. They should have contrubuted equally to his outer struggles. Was very much disappointed to see only a small para describing the first obe day double century.
An excellent account of Sachin's cricketing career and that of what Indian cricket was in those 24+ years with some glimpses of Sachin's personal and family life. This is the best gift of 2014 for many cricket lovers all over the world and most certainly for me. Thanks Amazon for allowing me to receive it in a such an easy way.
finished it ....sachin is the best....we saw ....funny ....naughty....normal....emotional....family guy....sachin's journey through his eyes...
.how he achieved the greatness.....but remain gentle....kind....always on the ground...only his bat talked....countless pains ....sacrifices...sheer hard work......passion....compassion......the man we all loved....lived his dream with our dream.....the tears on his failure...the joy n celebration on every little success ,he had we all had....our world stopped whenever he played....nothing else mattered ....his nervous nineties made us nervous....his 100s made us forget personal failures...a 16 year boy ....Indian conquered the world......we all did....honesty...kindness...politeness.....hard work....optimism...are his virtue...simplicity at its true beauty...an artist... true bharat ratna....world ambassador.....you will always be in our heart....will watch your innings again and again and again....we love u....thank u sachin
I go through the book, we respect the achivement of sachin tendulkar, but not his book, its not containing what we expected. it is like a redaing of his match innings,  90% of episode we knowing earlier. only good thing is i got the copy with lower price by amazon.in
thanking you
with regards

I think it's a very simple narration of key events of his life that made him the person he is. I liked it. There were many things we get to know about Sachin's professional as well as personal life.
If expecting an immensely motivational or dramatically controversial, this is not the book. It's simple and honest just like Sachin himself.
The book is well written and the enthusiam of Tendulkar is well captured... However could have been better if he himself wrote it. Many times it feels very unlike Tendulkar. Also Tendulkar is made to guiltless in the entire book and all his bad performances are made out to be due to circumstances and luck, which is something untrue.
Must have for all Sachin fans. Official one from the Little Master Himself.
Very simple and easy to read language. I personally found his schooling years, the struggles and the Shardhashram days most interesting and it will bring a smile to anyone.
Many photographs, stats etc.
Overall a good read
Let me make it clear that I consider myself the greatest Sachin fan alive. However I shall try to be fair in my review.
The first 100 or so pages that described Sachin's childhood formed the best part of the book. You would laugh, smile, get astonished and surprised ("Sachin used to do this to?" ...you would think). You will find that Sachin was, in most ways, the same cricket loving kid you were and will be able to relate to many of his mischief,ideas and thoughts.
However the fun ends along with those chapters. The rest of the book is a like a commentary of his matches. Almost all the matches have been included. It will refresh your memories of Sachin's batting, and you will relive some of the matches you might have forgotten.
However for a Sachin fan who would have certainly followed most of his career and would have all of his matches strong in his memory, this is provides little comfort. You expect more from Sachin than just summary of his matches.
Like most of the books on Sachin, this one too misses out on some of his iconic ODI innings. The 200 against SA is just brushed upon in commentary. The 175 VS Australia is not even mentioned. Focus is more on tests and less on ODIs.
I bought an edition with some great personal photographs of Sachin.
The book also does provide some dressing room gossips that Indian general fan always looks forward to, but in just the subtle amount. Strong views on Chappel, the 194 declaration by Dravid, some of his ideals and some surprising cricketers Sachin respects... all of these provide little  treats to the reader.
While some might skim through pages, this book provides some great insight  as to how Sachin used to prepare against some bowlers. How he used to adjust during difficult times. What strategies he used to form. At times I felt, how come Sachin has just hundred 100s, he should be having about 200 centuries. And this might just be the material a teenager, wanting to make a career in cricket might find extremely useful.
There is humor in appropriate amount. And almost all varities of statistics possible. Whole scorecards have been included.
This would be an ideal book to gift to your son/sibling if he is thinking of a future in cricket as his career.
I give it 3.5 stars.
Autobiography :  is a written account of the life of a person written by that person.
There are good things and bad things. This book has become more fiction like rather an autobiography. There are only good things that he talks about and has remained netural all the other things that happened.
Read Sachin's autobiography written by Boria Majumdar in about 3 sitting. The first thought on completing the book was how conveniently some topics were removed or just touched briefly to avoid any controversy and how great the book was marketed so that each and everybody should go and read it. Sachin has systematically taken us ( the reader ) step by step from the childhood to retirement. The childhood memories were the best part of the book as it revealed somethings that many of us did not know. Also his great admiration and love for his family is well portrayed and stands in good light for those who follow Sachin - the Bharat Ratna.
  Overall the book is all about his journey in terms of how many runs he has scored in a match, how he tacked the best of the bowlers, how unlucky he was because of some umpire decisions went against him ( which could have been omitted a few times ) , what he ate after the matches. The book essentially lacks the insights, the dramas, the thought process, and his opinions on others. The book is all about 'my runs', 'my shots', 'my team' and 'my country'. We all love Sachin for what he has done for India and in true sense is a Bharat Ratna. Throughout a carrier of about 20+ years he has shown maturity, dignity and has been humble in all possible conditions he has been put too. But the book definitely lacks a punch; it is rather a a scorecard rather than personal journal.
A very descriptive autobiography by a very simple and humble man whom we all love and pray for..one who made every Indian forget their own problems for a moment at least .. a stop to whole nation..winning so many hurdles in life and on field..
Sachin is a immortal man and a hardworking caring person. India is his pride and honour. Cricket was his life for 21 years. Knows everything and is known by everyone related to cricket in any form
Sachin Tendulkar is a phenom that has made all sports grow better in India as well as many sports persons. He has filled in dreams  for the next generation through his own examples. He is just putting these and many unknown things about his life for everyone to be inspired to live and work for India as a true humble person.
Thanks Amazon for prompt service. Bought it for gifting a sachin fan. He was totally disappointed with it, and told "Better watch his innings". This autobiography is not up to expectations. Maybe a fan could write a far better biography for him.
It's give me to close view about sachin life. it's a really good to know the secrete thing in sachin life.His passion about game as a team player, as a supportive senior , friendship , people expectation and much more.. I love this book. Thanks Sachin for this great gift to your love-once.
WE LOVE YOU SACHIN......
WONDERFUL BOOK.....
EVERY TIME WE TURN ON THE TV TO WATCH A CRICKET MATCH WE ALL WISH THAT ITS YOU WHO IS COMING TO BAT WITH THAT ADIDAS BAT AND ENTERTAIN US ALL......MISS U
 Dear viewers if you read this book it is going to be a lifetime experience
Never expected something humorous from a sports legend. Credits to Boria Majmudar for narrating it in a way that excites a common man. It gives access to Sachin's personal life which he always given shield and privacy. Even if you are not a vivid reader of books, it will be easy to go on.
Though am a die hard fan of sachin, but his autobiography left me quite disappointed. It failed to provide the insights into cricket and his personal life that a reader would look forward to. Most of it contained the information that a person who follows Sachin and cricket already knows.
An insight into the enviable journey travelled by the Cricket God, through his own words. A must to read and have book not only for all Sachin's fans but also for all true Indian cricket lovers because, Sachin's Biography and Indian Cricket History, during his period are the same.
Is there any necessity to write anything on this book? It's a treasure. Price is reasonable but what about for those who can't afford to buy it. I happened to visit my native village and donated the book to the village library. The youngsters treated this book just as a Holy Book.
Honestly, i didnt thought it would make me curious, smile, laugh and emotional while reading it. But this book has got all the ingredients. There are many short stories about his confrontrations with opponents which would held you on your seats and will make you owe later.
Well drafted autobiography. ST could have discussed more about the present/future crop of players. Surprised not much has been mentioned about Dhoni, one of our most successful captians in all forms of Cricket. Book packaging and delivery very well handled by Amazon.
The life story of a Superhuman. Has been my idol since childhood. But still there were certain lovely secrets, of which we all knew nothing. The potrayal of a life so special... which inspired billions. Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. A must read for one and all.
A book which is riding on the popularity of the name! And, of course, on the press hype. Little in substance.
Should have been more informative and should have contained incidents that were not in public domain earlier. Whatever is there are already known to the readers. Disappointing. NAM BARE DARSHAN CHOTE.
the much anticipated book included more of stats which are better available on cricinfo.
would have been better if god of cricket would have shared some more incidents  of his cricketing career
Amazon delivery is good. received before delivery date..
About Book, As lik many am also a Hardcore fan of sachin I love the book.  Chance to know about his personal feel as a crickter.
Enjoyed reading the book...cricket, cricket & cricket...very well written....could have been more interesting if other items like dressing room chats, in field banters etc. were also included...
I expected more from Sachin in his autobiography. Very disappointed since he hasnt shared much on how he thinks, strategizes the game. He has also avoided the match-fixing saga of the late 90s.
Words straight from Gods mouth......we all know about his cricket it would have been good had he written more about his personal views on the issues related to cricket like match fixing....
The book provides a wonderful insight into all those little details which would been overshadowed in the scheme of larger things....absolute joy to read and very friendly language used too
not as expected, I am very disappointed with the book.
Content and some cricket  moments can keep you busy but the pattern of writing is not as expected, could have been better.
A must read for a Sachin fan; No startling revelations; One thing that struck me was the amount of injuries he had to deal with over the course of his career. Hats off to his passion!
Amazing!!!!!
I think every Indian must read it. I am writing this review after completion of 25% of the book. I am reading slowly because I really dont want to finish it.
The book did not live upto the expectations. He has avoided most of the controversies which rocked world cricket during his time.
The book just focuses on Indian victories and how Sachin played his part in those.
One of the disappointing innings by Sachin... Not much insight..  I played this tour on this day... We played well/badly.. We won/lost the match... This is how the book goes... Cricinfo's timeline does a better job..
It was a good read. Being a Sachin fan I never knew he had to battle some injuries or the other throughout his long career. You would get an insight about how  great sportsman live their lives after reading this book
Must read for any individual. People only see the successful  face and not the effort behind that success. It's not about Tendulkar's success, it's about all people who supported and helped him cultivate his talent.
Sachin was always my hero and still he is my idol.Whatever he does he always carry some sort of good information for our society.i cud not control my tears when he was delivering his farewell speech .he is an icon.
Interesting book but very lengthy should have been short
The book is good. We can read a single time. It shows us how dedicated he is, hardships he has faced as a cricketer.
He is a true Inspiration to Younger ones who wants to get into the field of Cricket.
Being a hardcore Sachin fan this book is awesome for me. Loved it!
A small suggestion - Buy this book only if you are a cricket fan or else you'll feel it boring after half of the book is over.
Had a lot of expection from the book. Expected Sachin to elaborate more on match fixing scandal, Greg chapel era and also on how he prepared for matches instead of writing about what happened in matches.
Loved the book as I got to know a lot about the Wizard of cricket himself, enjoyed reading many anecdotes and life of great Cricket legend. This book is for Sachin lovers and not necessarily book lovers.
You get to know out of scene moments of major incidents happened n indian cricket. Also ull know more about sachins personel and childhood life.
Poorly written bio, disappointing from a man of his caliber. Very few personal insights, more a recollection of scoreboards, injuries and food.
Its interesting to read master blasters childhood and how he trained to get to top.. its not a life story type but the incidents and experiance
Excellent book for true sachin's fan because it contains whole story about his life n describe all the matches he played in his 24 year career
Decent read. Book was silent on sachin's inherent motivation of scoring runs on all terrain...
Indeed he is " Bharat Ratna"
leaves a tear drop in the eye of every cricket fan! the mammoth size is justified by the 24 year long marvelous career! the work of a genius!
simple, honest and descriptive. One may find Autobiographies to be boring but grab this edition of the legend and I bet you cant put it down.
Good read for Sachin Fans. Deliberately seems to have ignored match fixing controversy and his review of bowlers and batsmen during his time.
Book is awesome like Sachin. I'm still in middle of da book nd enjoying a lot. Thanks to sachin for sharing his story..............brilliant.
May not be a literary gem, but it's an honest book from the gentleman of the game. Could replace the book of history of cricket, undoubtedly.
excellent. a true portrayal of  Sachin's personal and professional life.
made a very pleasant reading..simple and lucid presentation.
on page 7 at the last para, Dreaming of a bicycle, it is "a" instead of" I".
Thanks Sachin for a wonderful book and to make or life more beautiful . You are an inspiration to all of us and this book just ignites the spark more strongly . Dear viewers if you read this book it is going to be a lifetime experience
The story telling is honestly not that great but it's Sachins story so its gotta be worth reading! Its like going to Kashmir and taking a picture, it doesn't matte how (not) skilled the photographer is, it's going to be an amazing one.
This is a must read.  Started reading it and could not stop before it finished.  An isight to Sachin's life.  Some of the controvorsies were not discussed which leaves viewers wanting for just a bit  more.  All in ll a great reading.
Expected more intense and less crib from sachin. Disappointed
Nothing much to say about this book, received ok, but there was no lamination-seal on the book (my colleague got a laminated sealed copy of the book from Amazon), first I thought it is a used one. But overall I am satisfied.
Readable for a cricket lover who has grown along and followed Sachin's career.... Not much of Masala.... There are so many secrets in cricket but he has skirted around them.... A gentleman's book !!! Readable but not HOT !!!
Its a great book. Generally, autobiographies are full of self appraisals but this book is mostly the true account of Sachin's life. Amazon's packaging and delivery is great as always. Worth reading for all reading lovers.
Awesome book by Sachin sir.
The perfect story wid every chapter he touched our hearts wid his life story and we know from this that how he became the god of cricket wid dedication and hard work.
Hats off to u.
It is just awesome...... This man was under scanner for whole career and still has so much to say..... no controversies.... it's written in a dignified way..... hats off The master...... it's not just a book, it's as precious as geeta/bible/quran for cricket lovers.......:-) :-)
The service of the amezon is good but i have not like the case of the product the sticker of the book is getting loose at the first time  when i have broke the sealm of the packege
Nice book as a fan brought and studied...
Felt happy not only happy extreme happy...feeling proud of him and proud to be his name from my childhood and wanna continue forever
I really liked the way it's been written... got to know about Sachin Tendulkar personal side which is unknown and it's really heart-touching to know his struggles and hard work...
The book contains the fact that most of us already know. Missed the charm most autobiographies have.
5-stars for Amazon for delivering the product within a single day.
It was nice to read the book & to know a few issues which were not known . Thanks to Sachin for giving us a few hints, what are
happening in Cricket in India & in the World.
WE LOVE YOU SACHIN......EVERY TIME WE TURN ON THE TV TO WATCH A CRICKET MATCH WE ALL WISH THAT ITS YOU WHO IS COMING TO BAT WITH THAT MRF BAT AND ENTERTAIN US ALL......MISS U
I M DIE HEAD FAN OF SACHIN TENDULKAR'S BATTING
BOOK IS VERY GOOD FOR SACHINS FANS ITS MASTER STROKE
GO FOR IT
SPECIAL REPUBLIC DAY OFFER
DONT MISS IT
I have bought it on COD basis and received in excellent condition. The price in book stall is 899 and i got it in 476 only which is more than 50%. What more can expect.
Its a good book for cricket lovers. You can feel the sentiments going through a player's mind on and off the cricket field. Only flaw is use of too many statistics.
interesting book. the time of ordering it was showing delivery will be in 4 working days but i got it the next day itself. the packing was very good and safe too...
The journey of the sport's biggest and nation's greatest cricketing hero from his initial days to being a BHARAT RATNA recipient. Needless to say.....AWE-INSPIRING
It's best book about sachin's life..its contain all about sachin exclusive pictures, family photos etc..if you can buy must buy this...also its inspirational book
No fault with the book or the quality but the packaging needs to be modified I suppose. Despite of having such a hard cover, all the corners are bent inwards.
Sachin is worth to be praised on field but reading his point of view on Yuvraj in world cup 2011 was complete disappointment. A man with a big "I".
Disappointed... maybe due to unrealistic expectation..most of the things said in the book are common knowledge. No revelations. Just statements and facts.
Playing it My way is a simple and sweet writing of @SRT, its just like watching his batting without any disturbance. Thank you SRT for this presentation
One can get lot of inspiration, motivation out of this awesome book. My respectful pranam to this great son of Mother India. ...Sachin Tendulkar.
Its an average book. Could not met upto my expectations as most of the info looks as if its a copy paste from a news paper or a cricket database.
Very well written!! The god himself describes his life with full grace!! His passion for the sport is beyond reach of anyone's
imagination!!
Its good but not as much revealing as one would expect from an autobiography . Its merely a gratitude towards his fan and fraternity in general.
I gifted the book to my boyfriend who is a huge fan of Sachin Tendulkar. I remember how emotional he got listening to Sachin's farewell speech. He loved this gift from me. Excellent gift for Sachin fan :) I am yet to read the book. Waiting for him to finish.
Every house need to have this book and each youth/child should read it. "The beauty of pureness", "effects of parents eth;ics on a child","to growup well  children's childhood matters the most", etc. You get to know from this book
I am a huge fan of Sachin and this is why its my first buy in book category of my life and i am fully satisfied with it. Just one flaw that its cover have to be protected which may become dirty because of it white color. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.
I cried when he announced 200 will be his last.
I cried when he entered Wankhede for one last time with Indian cricket jersey.
I cried whenever I saw his glimpse on TV.
I cried when he scored his last runs for India.
I cried when he gave hell of emotional speech.
He made my childhood days awesome.
I am proud I watched # cricketto see his bat only.
Now I am crying as that child has died on this day, last year.
I will cry again remembering those unforgettable memories.
This book showcases Tendulkar's razor sharp memory but nothing much beyond it. Its a plain narrative of his entire career right from early childhood days.. not much insights into his psyche or how Indian Cricket is managed, the politics around it etc.
Great book. But again, Sachin has kept it very very professional with not many juicy bits. But indeed great to know in detail on how much Sachin struggled everyday to be the master he is. One time read but definitely a collector's treasure.
his autobiography contains the content which we all generally know through media barring few photos. Nothing interesting or any more insights into the dressing room chats, controversies and their discussions etc, hence making it an OK read.
Not what I expected from an autobiography. This seems to be just a chronological summary of Sachin's playing career without any soul in it - it just goes on to say "this happened, then this happened, then this happened". I don't mind that he skipped the match fixing and spot fixing controversies, but then there is nothing in terms of how the team was built, what was the team mindset in Australia '02 - '03, or Kolkata '01... there seems to be no feeling in what has been written. To be fair, there are some poignant passages - like WC'99 when Sachin's father died and the Kenya match after that when he go 140*, or when Dravid declared in Multan with him on 194* or his epic 241* in Sydney, but there are few and far in between.
Compared to something like Agassi's autobiography, this makes for very bland reading. It's just like the man himself, totally non controversial. Maybe my expectations were high but in all fairness, what a cricinfo.com editor like Sid Vaidyanathan or Sid Monga writes about cricket impacts me more than this book did.
Its is an easy book  to read. More enjoyable by cricket fans who can relive their memories of watching sachin batting. However it does feel underwhelming for those expecting a detailed analysis of state of cricket during the last 25 years.
Reads like a text. Plain and simple, to the extent of being labelled as boring! Sachin doesn't share his insights about the game, and his thoughts on critical issues like match-fixing. May be he played the game just for its enjoyment, and made a shield wall around himself and avoided all other thoughts.
A must kept book for Sachin's fan. Gives a first hand exp of his journey from a lanky boy to the Masterblaster slong with some amazing pics.
On time delivery.  I am very happy
The book arrived before time and in great condition. it is a pleasant read!! and a perfect gift for a cricket lover and a sachin die hard!
Superb book, well written by Sachin and Mujumdar. I could really correlate the lifestyle Sachin lived till his teens with every Mumbaikar.
Its okey, not nail biting and very interesting.i brought for Mr Tendulkar and am a die hard fan of The masterblaster.
Salute you sir
GOOD ,but I had expected a signed copy which I did not receive.
THERE WAS NO HARD COVER EITHER.
Appreciate the timely delivery.
Sachin played with his heart and so has he done with the pen in his hand this time. This book is one of the finest work. The words have come out as straight as his drives. Right from the heart of the man with a heart of gold. It is simple yet intriguing. What makes this book stand out is the fact that this comes from the man who has seldom spoken publicly on what goes in his life. A life which every Indian was part of in one way or the other. They wanted to hear what their hero had to say. This book is a salute to anyone and everyone who has been his fan and more for those who have not liked him for whatever reasons. Tendulkar being Tendulkar has once again delivered to the expectation of a billion people.
"Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked in and off the 22 yard belt for 22 years"
For them who could not see this man conduct himself in and off the field and get inspired, this book should serve the purpose.
The book is below expectations. It is more of a stats book than biography. Espncricinfo articles are far better than this. Disappointed!
Inspiring book for one and all. Especially, the Engish used is simple and clear and thus making it easy to comprehend by all age groups.
It's a very good book, which gives an insight look in the life of the world's greatest batsman. The book keeps you engaged till the end.
Its a very inspiring book. It talks about many incidences which were otherwise unknown. Really enjoyed reading it. Hooked till the end.
A must read for all Sachin (cricketer and person) fans!
Could have been better by including instances from Sachin's personal life.
What Can I say about this book.!! The name it self suggests. Quality wise this is good book. I will keep it with me for a memories..!!
Its entire Life sketched on paper!!
Really awesome, very Inspiring and teaches how positive approach leads one to success!
THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.
SACHIN HATS OFF FOR THIS BIOGRAPHY.
HAD TEARS WHEN READING SOME EMOTIONAL RETIREMENT EVENTS
Brilliant book. If you are a cricket fan, you will love this book. Sachin has wrote this book from his heart and it contains the inside story of Indian dressing room too. He has touched all controversies. I can write a book while reviewing this book. It is the first english book which I have bought and reading with so much interest. It is a book I will keep throughout my life with me.
Thank you so much amazon for making the start of this sunday so awesome!!
Like every cricket crazy Indian, pre ordered it and got it today. Time to revisit childhood. Must buy everyone. For those who do not love cricket.. U must read this... U'll definetly fall for it.
presented beautifully.
The expectations of a proud INDIAN is always high from a man of his stature. I expected more from him .
An uninteresting account of an otherwise exciting career!
Sachin should have chosen a better writer to pen his autobiography.
Thank you, Sachin!
You will rewind your old cricket viewing experience through each page.
Very prompt delivery by Amazon
The autobiography of living god, you will real feel great while reading. God has opened every aspect of  his life.... :)
What do I write about life of God!!!
So the content is great only..  and so is the book quality and amazon service!
love it... this is so motivating !!
More than a cricketer he is one of the best human being alive in this world!!!
he is silent on so many crucial issues importantly regarding match fixing nd drs. a man of his stature needs to open up
SRT - wish you would have played some more years to give us more excitements on field & later translate into books ..
If u are Indian , if u are cricket fan, if u know English.
And if any of the above u fit in, this book is must!
Fantastic book! Even my wife, not a lover of cricket, fully read it without dropping. Sachin's honesty is exemplary.
The book is real inspiration and full of truth about Sachin's play. Every follower of Sachin should read this book.
I am impressed with the service. Good. I will keep buy books and other things in Amazon as it meets my expectation.
Amazing read! And you will feel Sachin , ie his humbleness in the entire book. Masterpiece from the little master!
A good stuff with lot of excitement n fun..n also there is many unknown things which really make it worthful buy..
St wrote superb. .. whenever I started to read it den I will not like to leave the vook until it will be finished
Fantastic read in terms of what makes the man Sachin Tendulkar a great idol and brans ambassador as a Sportsman.
The man who cricket loved back.... Amazing, inspirational... Ramayan, Bible, Khurran and Playing It My Way......
it's a very interesting, nice and great book. It contains many details about Sachin Tendulkar my favorite player
This Book is a must for all Sachin Fans. It's a collectors item. You can say, this is THE HOLY BOOK of Cricket.
Book realeased on November 6th and I had it in my hands on 7th November.
Perfect way to settle my weekend.
What a brilliant player and now what a philosophy of words painted for him.
Gr8 experience. I loved it !!
Book Is Too Good. Even Pages Are Around 500 Still Book Weight Is Less. Pages Quality Also Beyond Expectations.
Must read for a Sachin fan. I don't think people who don't like following cricket would appreciate this book.
Brilliant book by the Little Master. It felt as if Sachin himself is in front of me and telling his life's story. Very nice book.
Good...could have been better...but am glad that GOD himself incarnated and penned down some(not all) of his hidden treasures!!!
Amazing Book. Great efforts put on by all the persons to make it successful. Easy read and attention grabbing events. Thank You.
From Amazon perspective, it was delivered on time. The book is worth a read for anybody inIndia who loves cricket and Sachin.
The book is great. All credit goes to Sachin not to you guys. Your delivery was pathetic. The delivery was delayed by 4 days.
Honesty Is The Name Of The God Of The Cricket ....... Every Cricketeer Should Must Read It....
I Recomended For Everyone
The experience go through the life with GOD of cricket the narration is simply superb it is the bible for SACHIN lovers. . .
Amazing service by amazon.

Absolutely amazing! Don't hesitate, its that man! this book is from his heart! go get a copy! #ThankYouSachin once more! and prompt delivery by amazon! the book was released on 6th and I received it on 8th at around 1 pm.
Nice quality, immediate delivery, packing a bit uneven, but no damage to the book.....nice experience....Fully satisfied!
It not merely out of loyalty that I give this book 5 stars, it really is a worthy read for anyone who has followed him and also very young generation who want to understand why he has a special place in our hearts... Him talking about his favourite series which ironically turns out to be the one where he bowled wonderfully in the last match, and world cup 2003 with the trials and tribulations of nervousness and dehydration and real exhaustion and still finding the strength to carry on... I hoped he would talk about the 98 against Pakistan and he did, and I dont think he realises how inspiring it is to hear his anecdotal reference to the preparation before the next match, for him its probably just an embarrassingly funny story... but as a reader I felt ashamed of how laid-back I am about my passions.
The chapter on his wife and marriage is kind of the stuff romantic movies are made of, pretty sure some filmmaker will realise it soon.. anyway, it seems I can ramble on about this... in a nutshell, its wonderful book... yeah there is no scandoloud expose about matchfixing, but I knew that even before I read it, cause you know him, Its just not his way ;)
This is my first review here and I am so glad its for a book he wrote
The book as such reads like a Journal - mostly a running commentary of matches (although important, key matches) which gets monotonous after a while. That is something, since all the matches mentioned are the milestone matches in Sachin's career and for any fan of Indian cricket, that holds considerable interest.
Sachin's relations within his family, especially with his kids, with teammates, and the food he had during his tours, besides personal anecdotes from some of the matches are broadly the highlights of the book. Also,finer points of his playing technique are mentioned here and there, which would be of interest to the keen follower of the game.
The part of the book that lets you down is its non-controversial stand on most issues. Match fixing is mentioned only in passing, barely a few pages are dedicated to the Monkeygate scandal. BCCI is held up in high esteem almost everywhere. Most surprisingly, Yuvraj Singh's struggle with cancer and Sachin's stint with the Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member do not find a mention in this book.
It is still worth buying and reading, because it is Sachin after all. The pictures generously sprinkled within the book are a collector's delight. What strikes one throughout the book is the straightforward, uncomplicated approach that Sachin seems to have towards his life. That alongwith the devotion towards family, the patriotism and the attention to the minutest details of the sport are the key impressions one could treasure, as we complete this book.
Being a vivid Sachin fan I expected more of thought process and behind the screens happenings in the game and in the dressing room. But this book is disappointment on this front. This book is more of various essays about all his innings put together.
Even after reading the book you wont get a feeling that you know Sachin more than before reading it.
I am a big fan of Sachin. Got this book thinking will get to see it from the masters point of view. Have to say that I was disappointed. Pretty much what was in the newspaper and various columns were all collected and logically arranged.
If you are fan and feel that you need to have a copy of this for your collection, then buy it otherwise you can give it a pass.
When you follow a sports personality and the game passionately for so long, you'd expect the life story to be equally riveting. This books while good and informative falls short of being great. It seems rather superficial and gives you nothing but a bit more than what is already known about the man. It doesn't help that there are pages and pages of statistics which seem to be there for the sole purpose of filling up pages.
It would've been nice to have some personal views from the man on things like the match fixing scandal and his views of Azharuddin and Jadeja getting caught in the storm, his relationship with Vinod Kambli or even more anectodes if being on tour. Maybe, like with his batting we come to expect too much from him...
The first thing I saw and liked about the book is its photographs. The book has a nice collection of pictures from Sachin's playing career. He brings to life the old test matches of the late 90's  which many people of my age started watching cricket with. His criticisms of the people around him are very subtle but if recognised, one is sure to have a good laugh at them. The tone of his writing, as expected is very idealistic(which is very typical to Sachin Tendulkar) but likeable for a fan like me. If the reader is not a great fan, he/she might not like this as much.
The book is an above average read. If you are a fan, you will like this in your collection. However, if you are not, this might not be liked a lot.
There's nothing in it which we don't know. Rather than describing his hardships and mental make-up for the game, the book just feels like a scorecard and summary of every series he played. If you are not a cricket fan, you should stay away from this and if you are one, then too you will be disappointed with this.
Very poor writing (almost high school standards), and hardly any personal insights. The book reads like a paraphrasing of scorecards from the past. A safe and rather bland offering from which, I would strongly recommend, any bibliophile stay miles away.
In last 20 odd years, I loved reading anything written on Sachin and was hoping for great insight about this man. Honestly, it was bit disappointing except for first few chapters and last few chapters. I felt like some of the contents were rushed through in hurry. Though I'm not dissapointed by Sachin himself, but certainly Author has done poor job in extracting best out of Sachin and articulating in rather insightful way. Perhaps, it would have been good idea to write multiple volumes rather than rushing through all in one shot. No matter what, my admiration for Sachin will be same forever.
Finished reading the book " Playing It My Way" an autobiography of Sachin Tendulkar. For those in search of any sensational revelations in the book, it is a a disappointment. Nobody expects from a person who has steered clear of any controversy during his playing days, to create any sort of controversy at this stage. Though a major portion of the book just appears as statement of facts, hence repetition of what is already universally known , the author should not be blamed for that because the events surrounding Tendulkar ,on and off the field, have unfolded before us in the last 25 years or so. In the narrative, there are many instances of mind games played and strategies adopted to outwit the opposition which makes up for very interesting reading. A disappointing aspect in the book, however is that the author has not devoted much space to some of his great contemporaries. No mention is made about Kapil Dev's final appearance in test cricket though Sachin was a member of the team at that time. More surprisingly, some of the gem of innings played by Rahul Dravid hardly gets mentioned.Though Rahul and Sachin partnered in Test maches in 143 innings, and scored 6905 runs as partners with 20 century and 29 half century partnerships,it is surprising that Rahul's achievements and his contribution to Indian cricket has not found any place in the book. In this respect, Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S.Laxman should consider themselves slightly better off.
To sum up, much more was expected from Sachin Tendulkar,not only about himself, but also for his insights about those greats who played along with him and against him.
Being a Sachin's ardent fan I would like to buy this book at any cost(?) Not really, the discount given by amazon.com is really amazing and with no thought I ordered the book. It's worth reading. We easily criticize when a team loses, but the difficult times the players have to undergo is not known to many of them. Sachin has opened his heart and It is wonderful reading....
Haven't really expected much from this book. So much has already been written about Sachin.
I was rather expecting some rare and special photographs. But it was a disappointment. All the photographs are well seen.
Only one was special..the piece of paper Sachin used to write the names in his farewell speech!! This book has a nice photograph of that. :)
This is complete waste of time. I stopped reading it after 200 pages. It's like statsguru of cricinfo in a book filtered by Sachin. I expected so much more, I wanted to read his emotions, what he went through at the time of crisis like match fixing etc but nothing. I have seen sachin play from him first match and this book was like replay. Not recommended.
Well i am a huge sachin fan. But this book is not what i expected. Apart from some unknown incidents it doesnt provide much into tge life of God of Cricket. At the end i realised it was just a stats book. Not an autobiography.
And Amazon's service is way better then other online retailers. And that was the only thing i liked about the order.
The book is very descriptive. Maybe some people find it as less literature but it has all the description to how to be prepare as a sportsman more so over how to be a great human being. Sachin Tendulkar, The God as we know, din't hide when he sometime did behave wrongly. Every coach/parents read this book to prepare their children for the future.
The hardships which had Sachin had gone through in his childhood and the way he tackled them with his determination and willpower are a source of inspiration for all the youngsters. His humility and the love for all his relatives and well wishers are portrayed in the book in a very lucid manner. This book is truly a treasure to possess!!
Beautiful. Lot of things to know about. It goes from HHS childhood. Nice book. More of his stats and scores. Still nice to know how he grew and few things about the Indian cricket. How the pressure on the cricketers, etc. if you a fan of Sachin, then you'll buy and go for it. It's always good to know the one who you worshiped by himself.
Most of what is written in the book is about matches and scores that has already been printed. Was expecting to know more of his inner struggles and inner dialogues of the champion. They should have contrubuted equally to his outer struggles. Was very much disappointed to see only a small para describing the first obe day double century.
An excellent account of Sachin's cricketing career and that of what Indian cricket was in those 24+ years with some glimpses of Sachin's personal and family life. This is the best gift of 2014 for many cricket lovers all over the world and most certainly for me. Thanks Amazon for allowing me to receive it in a such an easy way.
It was an OK book. I was expecting an insight into his life whereas the book takes the reader to various incidents/ experiences and leaves it to the reader to form his opinion . Of course , very readable and simply presented
I am an ardent fan of Tendulkar and all through his cricketing years i used to be a vocal supporter and die-hard fan. In fact I have stopped watching cricket when he has retired. Now cricket is boring thing for me. I have bought this book with great expectations and I must say I am deeply disappointed. I cannot digest Sachin finding fault with Dravid for declaring the innings in Multan, Pakistan because he cannot get his double hundred. When I bought the book I did not expect it to be mystery thriller or page turner. But this book is a real bore. Only snippets here and there were interesting. Only the high regard for Sachin made me to buy this book.
Finished going through every pages of my Holy Book Playing it My Way the Autobiography of my God. The respect, Love, Devotion i had for him is just multiplied by infinite. Thoroughly enjoyed every bit of reading for the first time ever in my life, it took only 2 day's and night for me to complete the book of nearly 480 pages.
Top three phases of book I liked is:
1. When Sachin woke up in a middle of his surgery in April 2003. Went under knife on his left hand ring finger due to a calcification, he was so worried surgery will be made on his palm and the will force him to change the way he grips the bat.
It was an honour to read the story of Sachin Tendulkar...i was pretty excited when i started reading the book...
The book is overall good...but it feels like going through all the matches that tendulkar has played in his lifetime..
Its not waste of money...coz even a big sachin fan can miss out few things about sachin...while the book has lot of it...but the book doesn't actually inspires one..it gives the insight of sachin's life...
Still being a sachin fan i would always say....i loved the book...
as a sachin fan 95 % of the things written are know .
Well this is a story about God and his journey. Its fascinating and descriptive. I was simply amazed that Sachin remembers each and every match and also details. Book also covers a lot about Sachin's upbringing, family and his value system. I think for every cricket lover and Sachin fan its a MUST read book. Please also note that Sachin has not trashed or talked ill about anybody in the book so if you are looking to read some controversial information then this is certainly not a book for you!
This book as an auto biography is very  much  contrary  to  what  we think  about  Sachin. We know him  as a very humble  cricketer. But, after  reading  this  book, this  notion  is  blown  away. It  is  fully  about I, me and myself. It  is  very  difficult  to  digest  this  nature  of  Sachin.
In fact I am disappointed  and  disillusioned  to know  the  real Sachin.
From  now  on  I feel he was  a  great  cricketer. But  not  a great  team  player. Not  at  all.
I just loved it..he has won our hearts with his awesome performances throughout his career..and he is still doing the same thing even after his retirement..
Autobiographies by Indian players are very rare - we have had only one in the last twenty five years from Kapil Dev - so i  was expecting this to be a magnum opus - but it falls well short of expectation - only the sheer size and the brand name carries it through
This come out as more of a statistics and complete coverage of all the series Sachin has played and his dismissals- as ghosted by Boria M.But most of the autobiographies don't cover each and every series - usually the more prominent series are given more coverage.
There are some insights on his personal life , relationship with Anjali , his music likes etc and some thoughts on his personal battles and preparation for some key matches like Pakistan in 2003 and the Multan 2004 declaration- however what is missing is his thoughts on who were the best players he played against - who were the most difficult bowlers he  played against (apart from Cronje) - what would be his World XI  and of course some insights on the match fixing controversy.i would have wished this book to have focused more on Sachin's observations on techniques , some thoughts on his Indian team mates - what was his best Indian team etc and to be less obsessed with facts and figures.
I would refer to Ricky Ponting's book which had a lot of interesting snippets in boxes which would have embellished this long awaited book by Sachin.
Good Book to read it one time. However book is limited to descriptions of cricket matches Sachin played. His others features of personality left unnoticed.
after reading the 500 page book, my first feeling was 'sachin has written so little'. A sachin fan would have liked to know much more about sachin and his views on some critical topics. however reading the book is like revisiting the magic that sachin created all these years. it is a must read for all his fans. i am waiting for another book from the master himself, which will cover the portions left in this book. boria majumdar could have certainly done better in his narration. well,
The book got the response due to the cover photo. I guess you should read only if you are a Sachin fan. Infact it can be left even in that case also. Not very good writing style. Basically all the matches, tournaments he has played during his career have been explained along with scorecards.
I guess you should not buy a book for that. Speaking of the seller, I got it for really low price that the market rate. Amazon really surprises me with the prices in normal routine. Kudos.
This is more like an elaborate Wikipedia article on Sachin Tendulkar - neither a nuanced autobiography nor a great cricket book. There are even a number of proof-reading errors. Looks like a hastily prepared book. I am a Tendulkar fan. So no problem in keeping it as a memorabilia. Non-fans and those looking for serious cricket books or autobiographies may well leave this wide outswinger of a book. He has mastered the art of batting, but not the art of writing or story telling.
It not merely out of loyalty that I give this book 5 stars, it really is a worthy read for anyone who has followed him and also very young generation who want to understand why he has a special place in our hearts... Him talking about his favourite series which ironically turns out to be the one where he bowled wonderfully in the last match, and world cup 2003 with the trials and tribulations of nervousness and dehydration and real exhaustion and still finding the strength to carry on...

When you follow a sports personality and the game passionately for so long, you'd expect the life story to be equally riveting. This books while good and informative falls short of being great. It seems rather superficial and gives you nothing but a bit more than what is already known about the man. It doesn't help that there are pages and pages of statistics which seem to be there for the sole purpose of filling up pages.
It would've been nice to have some personal views from the man on things like the match fixing scandal and his views of Azharuddin and Jadeja getting caught in the storm, his relationship with Vinod Kambli or even more anectodes if being on tour. Maybe, like with his batting we come to expect too much from him...
The first thing I saw and liked about the book is its photographs. The book has a nice collection of pictures from Sachin's playing career. He brings to life the old test matches of the late 90's  which many people of my age started watching cricket with. His criticisms of the people around him are very subtle but if recognised, one is sure to have a good laugh at them. The tone of his writing, as expected is very idealistic(which is very typical to Sachin Tendulkar) but likeable for a fan like me. If the reader is not a great fan, he/she might not like this as much.
The book is an above average read. If you are a fan, you will like this in your collection. However, if you are not, this might not be liked a lot.
There's nothing in it which we don't know. Rather than describing his hardships and mental make-up for the game, the book just feels like a scorecard and summary of every series he played. If you are not a cricket fan, you should stay away from this and if you are one, then too you will be disappointed with this.
Very poor writing (almost high school standards), and hardly any personal insights. The book reads like a paraphrasing of scorecards from the past. A safe and rather bland offering from which, I would strongly recommend, any bibliophile stay miles away.
In last 20 odd years, I loved reading anything written on Sachin and was hoping for great insight about this man. Honestly, it was bit disappointing except for first few chapters and last few chapters. I felt like some of the contents were rushed through in hurry. Though I'm not dissapointed by Sachin himself, but certainly Author has done poor job in extracting best out of Sachin and articulating in rather insightful way. Perhaps, it would have been good idea to write multiple volumes rather than rushing through all in one shot. No matter what, my admiration for Sachin will be same forever.
Finished reading the book " Playing It My Way" an autobiography of Sachin Tendulkar. For those in search of any sensational revelations in the book, it is a a disappointment. Nobody expects from a person who has steered clear of any controversy during his playing days, to create any sort of controversy at this stage. Though a major portion of the book just appears as statement of facts, hence repetition of what is already universally known , the author should not be blamed for that because the events surrounding Tendulkar ,on and off the field, have unfolded before us in the last 25 years or so. In the narrative, there are many instances of mind games played and strategies adopted to outwit the opposition which makes up for very interesting reading. A disappointing aspect in the book, however is that the author has not devoted much space to some of his great contemporaries. No mention is made about Kapil Dev's final appearance in test cricket though Sachin was a member of the team at that time. More surprisingly, some of the gem of innings played by Rahul Dravid hardly gets mentioned.Though Rahul and Sachin partnered in Test maches in 143 innings, and scored 6905 runs as partners with 20 century and 29 half century partnerships,it is surprising that Rahul's achievements and his contribution to Indian cricket has not found any place in the book. In this respect, Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S.Laxman should consider themselves slightly better off.
To sum up, much more was expected from Sachin Tendulkar,not only about himself, but also for his insights about those greats who played along with him and against him.
This is an autibiography that would appeal to the diehard sachin fans. For me personally, it was a nostalgic read , reliving all his matches with some interesting titbits here and there. But for someone who hasn't followed his career so closely or someone who is cricket neutral , an endless grind of all his matches awaits you!
Great insights into the mind of one of the best batsman of the world. Some of the instances on how he interprets the ball before it is delivered talks volumes about the ability of this individual. Ideal only for people who have followed Indian cricket over years. The last part i.e. his retirement speech still gives goosebumps.
Great read... If u r an avid cricket fan then u can relate to the tournaments Sachin mentions... If u don't follow cricket closely u will still enjoy learning about the game. We often feel that Sachin is an effortless player but this book shows the immense hardwork he has put in and how consciously Sachin tries to be grounded
Like every one I also hoped the best from him.But it was not like an autobiography but can tell it as match to match statistics.Because it is really not an autobiography as written by Boria Mazumdar and Sachin has given him interviews.But it is not bad to buy it.Some recalls from Sachin about his life are worth to know....
I bought the autobiography with a lot of expectations and none were fulfilled - not written interestingly enough and not much insight into what was happening in his mind and in the cricket field. The silence on the match fixing controversy which affected so many of his colleagues is very disappointing. Overall a poor buy
Really very nice and wonderful one all the experience has place in reality way. It is extrimly difficult to place the cricket experience in form of book.
Really a great player our god of cricket and master blaster and little master.
SACHIN TENDULKAR SIR.
Regrads

Its an Awesome Book for Sachin Fans Specially when you take him as your God. And yes for non Sachin fans too its a wonderful book to read some real life fact files of the super human. Does not let you down. And yes if you have Sachin fans who don't buy the book gift them one as i did. Gives greater Joy.
It's hard to believe the way sachin handled everything at such a big stage for so long.....to predict the next  delivery even before the bowler has started his runup, shows his greatness!!!!!
Surely the content justifies the title of the book....What
 a man..... Sorry..... "SUPERMAN"
Amazing book with amazing illustrations. Brings back memories of childhood and eager waiting of master blaster to come on pitch. The alacrity with which Sachin has faced so many injuries and still served nation through cricket is totally inspiring. Respect aa hi jata hai bande ke liye... Sab padh ke.
He s a champ,the book has its mettle in proving that,but yes ,would have been happier if I would get to know more about his personal life other than cricket.....anyway I can understand he is not a writer by profession..this man is worth a salute,good read to reassure that anything can be achieved!!
finished it ....sachin is the best....we saw ....funny ....naughty....normal....emotional....family guy....sachin's journey through his eyes...
.how he achieved the greatness.....but remain gentle....kind....always on the ground...only his bat talked....countless pains ....sacrifices...sheer hard work......passion....compassion......the man we all loved....lived his dream with our dream.....the tears on his failure...the joy n celebration on every little success ,he had we all had....our world stopped whenever he played....nothing else mattered ....his nervous nineties made us nervous....his 100s made us forget personal failures...a 16 year boy ....Indian conquered the world......we all did....honesty...kindness...politeness.....hard work....optimism...are his virtue...simplicity at its true beauty...an artist... true bharat ratna....world ambassador.....you will always be in our heart....will watch your innings again and again and again....we love u....thank u sachin
I go through the book, we respect the achivement of sachin tendulkar, but not his book, its not containing what we expected. it is like a redaing of his match innings,  90% of episode we knowing earlier. only good thing is i got the copy with lower price by amazon.in
thanking you
with regards

I think it's a very simple narration of key events of his life that made him the person he is. I liked it. There were many things we get to know about Sachin's professional as well as personal life.
If expecting an immensely motivational or dramatically controversial, this is not the book. It's simple and honest just like Sachin himself.
The book is well written and the enthusiam of Tendulkar is well captured... However could have been better if he himself wrote it. Many times it feels very unlike Tendulkar. Also Tendulkar is made to guiltless in the entire book and all his bad performances are made out to be due to circumstances and luck, which is something untrue.
Must have for all Sachin fans. Official one from the Little Master Himself.
Very simple and easy to read language. I personally found his schooling years, the struggles and the Shardhashram days most interesting and it will bring a smile to anyone.
Many photographs, stats etc.
Overall a good read
Let me make it clear that I consider myself the greatest Sachin fan alive. However I shall try to be fair in my review.
The first 100 or so pages that described Sachin's childhood formed the best part of the book. You would laugh, smile, get astonished and surprised ("Sachin used to do this to?" ...you would think). You will find that Sachin was, in most ways, the same cricket loving kid you were and will be able to relate to many of his mischief,ideas and thoughts.
However the fun ends along with those chapters. The rest of the book is a like a commentary of his matches. Almost all the matches have been included. It will refresh your memories of Sachin's batting, and you will relive some of the matches you might have forgotten.
However for a Sachin fan who would have certainly followed most of his career and would have all of his matches strong in his memory, this is provides little comfort. You expect more from Sachin than just summary of his matches.
Like most of the books on Sachin, this one too misses out on some of his iconic ODI innings. The 200 against SA is just brushed upon in commentary. The 175 VS Australia is not even mentioned. Focus is more on tests and less on ODIs.
I bought an edition with some great personal photographs of Sachin.
The book also does provide some dressing room gossips that Indian general fan always looks forward to, but in just the subtle amount. Strong views on Chappel, the 194 declaration by Dravid, some of his ideals and some surprising cricketers Sachin respects... all of these provide little  treats to the reader.
While some might skim through pages, this book provides some great insight  as to how Sachin used to prepare against some bowlers. How he used to adjust during difficult times. What strategies he used to form. At times I felt, how come Sachin has just hundred 100s, he should be having about 200 centuries. And this might just be the material a teenager, wanting to make a career in cricket might find extremely useful.
There is humor in appropriate amount. And almost all varities of statistics possible. Whole scorecards have been included.
This would be an ideal book to gift to your son/sibling if he is thinking of a future in cricket as his career.
I give it 3.5 stars.
Autobiography :  is a written account of the life of a person written by that person.
There are good things and bad things. This book has become more fiction like rather an autobiography. There are only good things that he talks about and has remained netural all the other things that happened.
Read Sachin's autobiography written by Boria Majumdar in about 3 sitting. The first thought on completing the book was how conveniently some topics were removed or just touched briefly to avoid any controversy and how great the book was marketed so that each and everybody should go and read it. Sachin has systematically taken us ( the reader ) step by step from the childhood to retirement. The childhood memories were the best part of the book as it revealed somethings that many of us did not know. Also his great admiration and love for his family is well portrayed and stands in good light for those who follow Sachin - the Bharat Ratna.
  Overall the book is all about his journey in terms of how many runs he has scored in a match, how he tacked the best of the bowlers, how unlucky he was because of some umpire decisions went against him ( which could have been omitted a few times ) , what he ate after the matches. The book essentially lacks the insights, the dramas, the thought process, and his opinions on others. The book is all about 'my runs', 'my shots', 'my team' and 'my country'. We all love Sachin for what he has done for India and in true sense is a Bharat Ratna. Throughout a carrier of about 20+ years he has shown maturity, dignity and has been humble in all possible conditions he has been put too. But the book definitely lacks a punch; it is rather a a scorecard rather than personal journal.
A very descriptive autobiography by a very simple and humble man whom we all love and pray for..one who made every Indian forget their own problems for a moment at least .. a stop to whole nation..winning so many hurdles in life and on field..
Sachin is a immortal man and a hardworking caring person. India is his pride and honour. Cricket was his life for 21 years. Knows everything and is known by everyone related to cricket in any form
Sachin Tendulkar is a phenom that has made all sports grow better in India as well as many sports persons. He has filled in dreams  for the next generation through his own examples. He is just putting these and many unknown things about his life for everyone to be inspired to live and work for India as a true humble person.
Thanks Amazon for prompt service. Bought it for gifting a sachin fan. He was totally disappointed with it, and told "Better watch his innings". This autobiography is not up to expectations. Maybe a fan could write a far better biography for him.
I bought it for my husband who is a diehard Sachin fan...he not only follows his cricketing style but also adores him as the man himself off the field, his ideologies.I thought this book will have enough of the later one so pre-booked and gifted him...But While I started reading it I could just find that other than few small stories here and there Sachin has not really opened up himself  in this book to every situation;he has not stated how he thought,what was his reaction,thought process etc...It is true that he is such a talked about figure that nothing was unknown about him but wanted to see all these hard work,success,humility,honesty from his perspective....I felt that this book lacks that..other than few unknown stories (Anjali chapter, may be a little of Greg Chappel story(this hardly would be 10 liners)) it seemed to me like a match report summary of his entire carrier...Sachin fans please excuse me..but I stand by what I said... Thanks!!
excellent. a true portrayal of  Sachin's personal and professional life.
made a very pleasant reading..simple and lucid presentation.
on page 7 at the last para, Dreaming of a bicycle, it is "a" instead of" I".
Thanks Sachin for a wonderful book and to make or life more beautiful . You are an inspiration to all of us and this book just ignites the spark more strongly . Dear viewers if you read this book it is going to be a lifetime experience
The story telling is honestly not that great but it's Sachins story so its gotta be worth reading! Its like going to Kashmir and taking a picture, it doesn't matte how (not) skilled the photographer is, it's going to be an amazing one.
This is a must read.  Started reading it and could not stop before it finished.  An isight to Sachin's life.  Some of the controvorsies were not discussed which leaves viewers wanting for just a bit  more.  All in ll a great reading.
Expected more intense and less crib from sachin. Disappointed
Nothing much to say about this book, received ok, but there was no lamination-seal on the book (my colleague got a laminated sealed copy of the book from Amazon), first I thought it is a used one. But overall I am satisfied.
Readable for a cricket lover who has grown along and followed Sachin's career.... Not much of Masala.... There are so many secrets in cricket but he has skirted around them.... A gentleman's book !!! Readable but not HOT !!!
Its a great book. Generally, autobiographies are full of self appraisals but this book is mostly the true account of Sachin's life. Amazon's packaging and delivery is great as always. Worth reading for all reading lovers.
Awesome book by Sachin sir.
The perfect story wid every chapter he touched our hearts wid his life story and we know from this that how he became the god of cricket wid dedication and hard work.
Hats off to u.
It is just awesome...... This man was under scanner for whole career and still has so much to say..... no controversies.... it's written in a dignified way..... hats off The master...... it's not just a book, it's as precious as geeta/bible/quran for cricket lovers.......:-) :-)
It's give me to close view about sachin life. it's a really good to know the secrete thing in sachin life.His passion about game as a team player, as a supportive senior , friendship , people expectation and much more.. I love this book. Thanks Sachin for this great gift to your love-once.
WE LOVE YOU SACHIN......
WONDERFUL BOOK.....
EVERY TIME WE TURN ON THE TV TO WATCH A CRICKET MATCH WE ALL WISH THAT ITS YOU WHO IS COMING TO BAT WITH THAT ADIDAS BAT AND ENTERTAIN US ALL......MISS U
 Dear viewers if you read this book it is going to be a lifetime experience
Never expected something humorous from a sports legend. Credits to Boria Majmudar for narrating it in a way that excites a common man. It gives access to Sachin's personal life which he always given shield and privacy. Even if you are not a vivid reader of books, it will be easy to go on.
Though am a die hard fan of sachin, but his autobiography left me quite disappointed. It failed to provide the insights into cricket and his personal life that a reader would look forward to. Most of it contained the information that a person who follows Sachin and cricket already knows.
An insight into the enviable journey travelled by the Cricket God, through his own words. A must to read and have book not only for all Sachin's fans but also for all true Indian cricket lovers because, Sachin's Biography and Indian Cricket History, during his period are the same.
Is there any necessity to write anything on this book? It's a treasure. Price is reasonable but what about for those who can't afford to buy it. I happened to visit my native village and donated the book to the village library. The youngsters treated this book just as a Holy Book.
Honestly, i didnt thought it would make me curious, smile, laugh and emotional while reading it. But this book has got all the ingredients. There are many short stories about his confrontrations with opponents which would held you on your seats and will make you owe later.
Well drafted autobiography. ST could have discussed more about the present/future crop of players. Surprised not much has been mentioned about Dhoni, one of our most successful captians in all forms of Cricket. Book packaging and delivery very well handled by Amazon.
The life story of a Superhuman. Has been my idol since childhood. But still there were certain lovely secrets, of which we all knew nothing. The potrayal of a life so special... which inspired billions. Bharat Ratna Sachin Tendulkar. A must read for one and all.
A book which is riding on the popularity of the name! And, of course, on the press hype. Little in substance.
The service of the amezon is good but i have not like the case of the product the sticker of the book is getting loose at the first time  when i have broke the sealm of the packege
Nice book as a fan brought and studied...
Felt happy not only happy extreme happy...feeling proud of him and proud to be his name from my childhood and wanna continue forever
I really liked the way it's been written... got to know about Sachin Tendulkar personal side which is unknown and it's really heart-touching to know his struggles and hard work...
The book contains the fact that most of us already know. Missed the charm most autobiographies have.
5-stars for Amazon for delivering the product within a single day.
It was nice to read the book & to know a few issues which were not known . Thanks to Sachin for giving us a few hints, what are
happening in Cricket in India & in the World.
WE LOVE YOU SACHIN......EVERY TIME WE TURN ON THE TV TO WATCH A CRICKET MATCH WE ALL WISH THAT ITS YOU WHO IS COMING TO BAT WITH THAT MRF BAT AND ENTERTAIN US ALL......MISS U
I M DIE HEAD FAN OF SACHIN TENDULKAR'S BATTING
BOOK IS VERY GOOD FOR SACHINS FANS ITS MASTER STROKE
GO FOR IT
SPECIAL REPUBLIC DAY OFFER
DONT MISS IT
I have bought it on COD basis and received in excellent condition. The price in book stall is 899 and i got it in 476 only which is more than 50%. What more can expect.
Its a good book for cricket lovers. You can feel the sentiments going through a player's mind on and off the cricket field. Only flaw is use of too many statistics.
interesting book. the time of ordering it was showing delivery will be in 4 working days but i got it the next day itself. the packing was very good and safe too...
Its good but not as much revealing as one would expect from an autobiography . Its merely a gratitude towards his fan and fraternity in general.
You get to know out of scene moments of major incidents happened n indian cricket. Also ull know more about sachins personel and childhood life.
Poorly written bio, disappointing from a man of his caliber. Very few personal insights, more a recollection of scoreboards, injuries and food.
Its interesting to read master blasters childhood and how he trained to get to top.. its not a life story type but the incidents and experiance
Excellent book for true sachin's fan because it contains whole story about his life n describe all the matches he played in his 24 year career
Decent read. Book was silent on sachin's inherent motivation of scoring runs on all terrain...
Indeed he is " Bharat Ratna"
leaves a tear drop in the eye of every cricket fan! the mammoth size is justified by the 24 year long marvelous career! the work of a genius!
simple, honest and descriptive. One may find Autobiographies to be boring but grab this edition of the legend and I bet you cant put it down.
Good read for Sachin Fans. Deliberately seems to have ignored match fixing controversy and his review of bowlers and batsmen during his time.
Book is awesome like Sachin. I'm still in middle of da book nd enjoying a lot. Thanks to sachin for sharing his story..............brilliant.
The book did not live upto the expectations. He has avoided most of the controversies which rocked world cricket during his time.
The book just focuses on Indian victories and how Sachin played his part in those.
One of the disappointing innings by Sachin... Not much insight..  I played this tour on this day... We played well/badly.. We won/lost the match... This is how the book goes... Cricinfo's timeline does a better job..
It was a good read. Being a Sachin fan I never knew he had to battle some injuries or the other throughout his long career. You would get an insight about how  great sportsman live their lives after reading this book
Must read for any individual. People only see the successful  face and not the effort behind that success. It's not about Tendulkar's success, it's about all people who supported and helped him cultivate his talent.
Sachin was always my hero and still he is my idol.Whatever he does he always carry some sort of good information for our society.i cud not control my tears when he was delivering his farewell speech .he is an icon.
Interesting book but very lengthy should have been short
The book is good. We can read a single time. It shows us how dedicated he is, hardships he has faced as a cricketer.
He is a true Inspiration to Younger ones who wants to get into the field of Cricket.
Being a hardcore Sachin fan this book is awesome for me. Loved it!
A small suggestion - Buy this book only if you are a cricket fan or else you'll feel it boring after half of the book is over.
Had a lot of expection from the book. Expected Sachin to elaborate more on match fixing scandal, Greg chapel era and also on how he prepared for matches instead of writing about what happened in matches.
Loved the book as I got to know a lot about the Wizard of cricket himself, enjoyed reading many anecdotes and life of great Cricket legend. This book is for Sachin lovers and not necessarily book lovers.
The journey of the sport's biggest and nation's greatest cricketing hero from his initial days to being a BHARAT RATNA recipient. Needless to say.....AWE-INSPIRING
It's best book about sachin's life..its contain all about sachin exclusive pictures, family photos etc..if you can buy must buy this...also its inspirational book
No fault with the book or the quality but the packaging needs to be modified I suppose. Despite of having such a hard cover, all the corners are bent inwards.
Entertaining, Motivating at the same time Inspiring journey if cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar. Some of the pics in the books are rare to find. Thumbs Up!
Sachin is worth to be praised on field but reading his point of view on Yuvraj in world cup 2011 was complete disappointment. A man with a big "I".
Disappointed... maybe due to unrealistic expectation..most of the things said in the book are common knowledge. No revelations. Just statements and facts.
Playing it My way is a simple and sweet writing of @SRT, its just like watching his batting without any disturbance. Thank you SRT for this presentation
One can get lot of inspiration, motivation out of this awesome book. My respectful pranam to this great son of Mother India. ...Sachin Tendulkar.
Its an average book. Could not met upto my expectations as most of the info looks as if its a copy paste from a news paper or a cricket database.
Very well written!! The god himself describes his life with full grace!! His passion for the sport is beyond reach of anyone's
imagination!!
I gifted the book to my boyfriend who is a huge fan of Sachin Tendulkar. I remember how emotional he got listening to Sachin's farewell speech. He loved this gift from me. Excellent gift for Sachin fan :) I am yet to read the book. Waiting for him to finish.
Every house need to have this book and each youth/child should read it. "The beauty of pureness", "effects of parents eth;ics on a child","to growup well  children's childhood matters the most", etc. You get to know from this book
I am a huge fan of Sachin and this is why its my first buy in book category of my life and i am fully satisfied with it. Just one flaw that its cover have to be protected which may become dirty because of it white color. Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.
I cried when he announced 200 will be his last.
I cried when he entered Wankhede for one last time with Indian cricket jersey.
I cried whenever I saw his glimpse on TV.
I cried when he scored his last runs for India.
I cried when he gave hell of emotional speech.
He made my childhood days awesome.
I am proud I watched # cricketto see his bat only.
Now I am crying as that child has died on this day, last year.
I will cry again remembering those unforgettable memories.
This book showcases Tendulkar's razor sharp memory but nothing much beyond it. Its a plain narrative of his entire career right from early childhood days.. not much insights into his psyche or how Indian Cricket is managed, the politics around it etc.
Great book. But again, Sachin has kept it very very professional with not many juicy bits. But indeed great to know in detail on how much Sachin struggled everyday to be the master he is. One time read but definitely a collector's treasure.
his autobiography contains the content which we all generally know through media barring few photos. Nothing interesting or any more insights into the dressing room chats, controversies and their discussions etc, hence making it an OK read.
Not what I expected from an autobiography. This seems to be just a chronological summary of Sachin's playing career without any soul in it - it just goes on to say "this happened, then this happened, then this happened". I don't mind that he skipped the match fixing and spot fixing controversies, but then there is nothing in terms of how the team was built, what was the team mindset in Australia '02 - '03, or Kolkata '01... there seems to be no feeling in what has been written. To be fair, there are some poignant passages - like WC'99 when Sachin's father died and the Kenya match after that when he go 140*, or when Dravid declared in Multan with him on 194* or his epic 241* in Sydney, but there are few and far in between.
Compared to something like Agassi's autobiography, this makes for very bland reading. It's just like the man himself, totally non controversial. Maybe my expectations were high but in all fairness, what a cricinfo.com editor like Sid Vaidyanathan or Sid Monga writes about cricket impacts me more than this book did.
Its is an easy book  to read. More enjoyable by cricket fans who can relive their memories of watching sachin batting. However it does feel underwhelming for those expecting a detailed analysis of state of cricket during the last 25 years.
Reads like a text. Plain and simple, to the extent of being labelled as boring! Sachin doesn't share his insights about the game, and his thoughts on critical issues like match-fixing. May be he played the game just for its enjoyment, and made a shield wall around himself and avoided all other thoughts.
May not be a literary gem, but it's an honest book from the gentleman of the game. Could replace the book of history of cricket, undoubtedly.
A must kept book for Sachin's fan. Gives a first hand exp of his journey from a lanky boy to the Masterblaster slong with some amazing pics.
On time delivery.  I am very happy
The book arrived before time and in great condition. it is a pleasant read!! and a perfect gift for a cricket lover and a sachin die hard!
Superb book, well written by Sachin and Mujumdar. I could really correlate the lifestyle Sachin lived till his teens with every Mumbaikar.
Its okey, not nail biting and very interesting.i brought for Mr Tendulkar and am a die hard fan of The masterblaster.
Salute you sir
GOOD ,but I had expected a signed copy which I did not receive.
THERE WAS NO HARD COVER EITHER.
Appreciate the timely delivery.
Sachin played with his heart and so has he done with the pen in his hand this time. This book is one of the finest work. The words have come out as straight as his drives. Right from the heart of the man with a heart of gold. It is simple yet intriguing. What makes this book stand out is the fact that this comes from the man who has seldom spoken publicly on what goes in his life. A life which every Indian was part of in one way or the other. They wanted to hear what their hero had to say. This book is a salute to anyone and everyone who has been his fan and more for those who have not liked him for whatever reasons. Tendulkar being Tendulkar has once again delivered to the expectation of a billion people.
"Generations to come, it may well be, will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood walked in and off the 22 yard belt for 22 years"
For them who could not see this man conduct himself in and off the field and get inspired, this book should serve the purpose.
The book is below expectations. It is more of a stats book than biography. Espncricinfo articles are far better than this. Disappointed!
Inspiring book for one and all. Especially, the Engish used is simple and clear and thus making it easy to comprehend by all age groups.
Should have been more informative and should have contained incidents that were not in public domain earlier. Whatever is there are already known to the readers. Disappointing. NAM BARE DARSHAN CHOTE.
the much anticipated book included more of stats which are better available on cricinfo.
would have been better if god of cricket would have shared some more incidents  of his cricketing career
Amazon delivery is good. received before delivery date..
About Book, As lik many am also a Hardcore fan of sachin I love the book.  Chance to know about his personal feel as a crickter.
Enjoyed reading the book...cricket, cricket & cricket...very well written....could have been more interesting if other items like dressing room chats, in field banters etc. were also included...
I expected more from Sachin in his autobiography. Very disappointed since he hasnt shared much on how he thinks, strategizes the game. He has also avoided the match-fixing saga of the late 90s.
Words straight from Gods mouth......we all know about his cricket it would have been good had he written more about his personal views on the issues related to cricket like match fixing....
The book provides a wonderful insight into all those little details which would been overshadowed in the scheme of larger things....absolute joy to read and very friendly language used too
not as expected, I am very disappointed with the book.
Content and some cricket  moments can keep you busy but the pattern of writing is not as expected, could have been better.
A must read for a Sachin fan; No startling revelations; One thing that struck me was the amount of injuries he had to deal with over the course of his career. Hats off to his passion!
Amazing!!!!!
I think every Indian must read it. I am writing this review after completion of 25% of the book. I am reading slowly because I really dont want to finish it.
It's a very good book, which gives an insight look in the life of the world's greatest batsman. The book keeps you engaged till the end.
Its a very inspiring book. It talks about many incidences which were otherwise unknown. Really enjoyed reading it. Hooked till the end.
A must read for all Sachin (cricketer and person) fans!
Could have been better by including instances from Sachin's personal life.
What Can I say about this book.!! The name it self suggests. Quality wise this is good book. I will keep it with me for a memories..!!
Its entire Life sketched on paper!!
Really awesome, very Inspiring and teaches how positive approach leads one to success!
THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.
SACHIN HATS OFF FOR THIS BIOGRAPHY.
HAD TEARS WHEN READING SOME EMOTIONAL RETIREMENT EVENTS
Brilliant book. If you are a cricket fan, you will love this book. Sachin has wrote this book from his heart and it contains the inside story of Indian dressing room too. He has touched all controversies. I can write a book while reviewing this book. It is the first english book which I have bought and reading with so much interest. It is a book I will keep throughout my life with me.
Thank you so much amazon for making the start of this sunday so awesome!!
Like every cricket crazy Indian, pre ordered it and got it today. Time to revisit childhood. Must buy everyone. For those who do not love cricket.. U must read this... U'll definetly fall for it.
presented beautifully.
The expectations of a proud INDIAN is always high from a man of his stature. I expected more from him .
An uninteresting account of an otherwise exciting career!
Sachin should have chosen a better writer to pen his autobiography.
Nice quality, immediate delivery, packing a bit uneven, but no damage to the book.....nice experience....Fully satisfied!
The autobiography of living god, you will real feel great while reading. God has opened every aspect of  his life.... :)
What do I write about life of God!!!
So the content is great only..  and so is the book quality and amazon service!
love it... this is so motivating !!
More than a cricketer he is one of the best human being alive in this world!!!
he is silent on so many crucial issues importantly regarding match fixing nd drs. a man of his stature needs to open up
SRT - wish you would have played some more years to give us more excitements on field & later translate into books ..
If u are Indian , if u are cricket fan, if u know English.
And if any of the above u fit in, this book is must!
Fantastic book! Even my wife, not a lover of cricket, fully read it without dropping. Sachin's honesty is exemplary.
The book is real inspiration and full of truth about Sachin's play. Every follower of Sachin should read this book.
I am impressed with the service. Good. I will keep buy books and other things in Amazon as it meets my expectation.
Thank you, Sachin!
You will rewind your old cricket viewing experience through each page.
Very prompt delivery by Amazon
Brilliant book by the Little Master. It felt as if Sachin himself is in front of me and telling his life's story. Very nice book.
Good...could have been better...but am glad that GOD himself incarnated and penned down some(not all) of his hidden treasures!!!
Amazing Book. Great efforts put on by all the persons to make it successful. Easy read and attention grabbing events. Thank You.
From Amazon perspective, it was delivered on time. The book is worth a read for anybody inIndia who loves cricket and Sachin.
