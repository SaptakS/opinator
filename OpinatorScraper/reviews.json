[[{"reviews": ["It not merely out of loyalty that I give this book 5 stars, it really is a worthy read for anyone who has followed him and also very young generation who want to understand why he has a special place in our hearts... Him talking about his favourite series which ironically turns out to be the one where he bowled wonderfully in the last match, and world cup 2003 with the trials and tribulations of nervousness and dehydration and real exhaustion and still finding the strength to carry on... I hoped he would talk about the 98 against Pakistan and he did, and I dont think he realises how inspiring it is to hear his anecdotal reference to the preparation before the next match, for him its probably just an embarrassingly funny story... but as a reader I felt ashamed of how laid-back I am about my passions.", "The chapter on his wife and marriage is kind of the stuff romantic movies are made of, pretty sure some filmmaker will realise it soon.. anyway, it seems I can ramble on about this... in a nutshell, its wonderful book... yeah there is no scandoloud expose about matchfixing, but I knew that even before I read it, cause you know him, Its just not his way ;)", "This is my first review here and I am so glad its for a book he wrote", "Let me make it clear that I consider myself the greatest Sachin fan alive. However I shall try to be fair in my review.", "The first 100 or so pages that described Sachin's childhood formed the best part of the book. You would laugh, smile, get astonished and surprised (\"Sachin used to do this to?\" ...you would think). You will find that Sachin was, in most ways, the same cricket loving kid you were and will be able to relate to many of his mischief,ideas and thoughts.", "However the fun ends along with those chapters. The rest of the book is a like a commentary of his matches. Almost all the matches have been included. It will refresh your memories of Sachin's batting, and you will relive some of the matches you might have forgotten.", "However for a Sachin fan who would have certainly followed most of his career and would have all of his matches strong in his memory, this is provides little comfort. You expect more from Sachin than just summary of his matches.", "Like most of the books on Sachin, this one too misses out on some of his iconic ODI innings. The 200 against SA is just brushed upon in commentary. The 175 VS Australia is not even mentioned. Focus is more on tests and less on ODIs.", "I bought an edition with some great personal photographs of Sachin.", "The book also does provide some dressing room gossips that Indian general fan always looks forward to, but in just the subtle amount. Strong views on Chappel, the 194 declaration by Dravid, some of his ideals and some surprising cricketers Sachin respects... all of these provide little  treats to the reader.", "While some might skim through pages, this book provides some great insight  as to how Sachin used to prepare against some bowlers. How he used to adjust during difficult times. What strategies he used to form. At times I felt, how come Sachin has just hundred 100s, he should be having about 200 centuries. And this might just be the material a teenager, wanting to make a career in cricket might find extremely useful.", "There is humor in appropriate amount. And almost all varities of statistics possible. Whole scorecards have been included.", "This would be an ideal book to gift to your son/sibling if he is thinking of a future in cricket as his career.", "I give it 3.5 stars.", "Being a vivid Sachin fan I expected more of thought process and behind the screens happenings in the game and in the dressing room. But this book is disappointment on this front. This book is more of various essays about all his innings put together.", "Even after reading the book you wont get a feeling that you know Sachin more than before reading it.", "There's nothing in it which we don't know. Rather than describing his hardships and mental make-up for the game, the book just feels like a scorecard and summary of every series he played. If you are not a cricket fan, you should stay away from this and if you are one, then too you will be disappointed with this.", "The book as such reads like a Journal - mostly a running commentary of matches (although important, key matches) which gets monotonous after a while. That is something, since all the matches mentioned are the milestone matches in Sachin's career and for any fan of Indian cricket, that holds considerable interest.", "Sachin's relations within his family, especially with his kids, with teammates, and the food he had during his tours, besides personal anecdotes from some of the matches are broadly the highlights of the book. Also,finer points of his playing technique are mentioned here and there, which would be of interest to the keen follower of the game.", "The part of the book that lets you down is its non-controversial stand on most issues. Match fixing is mentioned only in passing, barely a few pages are dedicated to the Monkeygate scandal. BCCI is held up in high esteem almost everywhere. Most surprisingly, Yuvraj Singh's struggle with cancer and Sachin's stint with the Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member do not find a mention in this book.", "It is still worth buying and reading, because it is Sachin after all. The pictures generously sprinkled within the book are a collector's delight. What strikes one throughout the book is the straightforward, uncomplicated approach that Sachin seems to have towards his life. That alongwith the devotion towards family, the patriotism and the attention to the minutest details of the sport are the key impressions one could treasure, as we complete this book.", "When you follow a sports personality and the game passionately for so long, you'd expect the life story to be equally riveting. This books while good and informative falls short of being great. It seems rather superficial and gives you nothing but a bit more than what is already known about the man. It doesn't help that there are pages and pages of statistics which seem to be there for the sole purpose of filling up pages.", "It would've been nice to have some personal views from the man on things like the match fixing scandal and his views of Azharuddin and Jadeja getting caught in the storm, his relationship with Vinod Kambli or even more anectodes if being on tour. Maybe, like with his batting we come to expect too much from him...", "In last 20 odd years, I loved reading anything written on Sachin and was hoping for great insight about this man. Honestly, it was bit disappointing except for first few chapters and last few chapters. I felt like some of the contents were rushed through in hurry. Though I'm not dissapointed by Sachin himself, but certainly Author has done poor job in extracting best out of Sachin and articulating in rather insightful way. Perhaps, it would have been good idea to write multiple volumes rather than rushing through all in one shot. No matter what, my admiration for Sachin will be same forever.", "Even if Sachin scores reasonable runs but fail to reach 100 then most of us feel as if Sachin failed. That's his stature - we always demand the best of him. So it is obvious that we all must be having Everest high expectations from his book as well.", " Motivation, doubtless dedication, childish fun, a bit of romance, writhing in stress of expectations, bouncing back - this book tells it all. Hands off to the legend for giving very minute details of life even if sometime it is embarrassing and sometime controversial.", " But for some reasons to a great section of book lover it is not going to be a great book. Just like 90+ out score this book does not reciprocate to the highest level of expectations.", "My analysis goes like:", "-> For those who aim to play for state/country this book is a MUST read.", "-> For many cricket lovers who are not interested in technicality of the game  - a few chapters MUST be SKIPPED", "-> For those who have no extra warmth for cricket - only a few chapters can be read", "Finished reading the book \" Playing It My Way\" an autobiography of Sachin Tendulkar. For those in search of any sensational revelations in the book, it is a a disappointment. Nobody expects from a person who has steered clear of any controversy during his playing days, to create any sort of controversy at this stage. Though a major portion of the book just appears as statement of facts, hence repetition of what is already universally known , the author should not be blamed for that because the events surrounding Tendulkar ,on and off the field, have unfolded before us in the last 25 years or so. In the narrative, there are many instances of mind games played and strategies adopted to outwit the opposition which makes up for very interesting reading. A disappointing aspect in the book, however is that the author has not devoted much space to some of his great contemporaries. No mention is made about Kapil Dev's final appearance in test cricket though Sachin was a member of the team at that time. More surprisingly, some of the gem of innings played by Rahul Dravid hardly gets mentioned.Though Rahul and Sachin partnered in Test maches in 143 innings, and scored 6905 runs as partners with 20 century and 29 half century partnerships,it is surprising that Rahul's achievements and his contribution to Indian cricket has not found any place in the book. In this respect, Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S.Laxman should consider themselves slightly better off.", "To sum up, much more was expected from Sachin Tendulkar,not only about himself, but also for his insights about those greats who played along with him and against him.", "finished it ....sachin is the best....we saw ....funny ....naughty....normal....emotional....family guy....sachin's journey through his eyes...", ".how he achieved the greatness.....but remain gentle....kind....always on the ground...only his bat talked....countless pains ....sacrifices...sheer hard work......passion....compassion......the man we all loved....lived his dream with our dream.....the tears on his failure...the joy n celebration on every little success ,he had we all had....our world stopped whenever he played....nothing else mattered ....his nervous nineties made us nervous....his 100s made us forget personal failures...a 16 year boy ....Indian conquered the world......we all did....honesty...kindness...politeness.....hard work....optimism...are his virtue...simplicity at its true beauty...an artist... true bharat ratna....world ambassador.....you will always be in our heart....will watch your innings again and again and again....we love u....thank u sachin"]},

Credits to Boria Majmudar for narrating it in a way that excites a common man. It gives access to Sachin's personal life which he always given shield and privacy. Even if you are not a vivid reader of books, it will be easy to go on.", "Though am a die hard fan of sachin, but his autobiography left me quite disappointed. It failed to provide the insights into cricket and his personal life that a reader would look forward to. Most of it contained the information that a person who follows Sachin and cricket already knows.", "Is there any necessity to write anything on this book? It's a treasure. Price is reasonable but what about for those who can't afford to buy it. I happened to visit my native village and donated the book to the village library. The youngsters treated this book just as a Holy Book.", "Honestly, i didnt thought it would make me curious, smile, laugh and emotional while reading it. But this book has got all the ingredients. There are many short stories about his confrontrations with opponents which would held you on your seats and will make you owe later.", "Well drafted autobiography.

Excellent gift for Sachin fan :) I am yet to read the book. Waiting for him to finish.", "Great book. But again, Sachin has kept it very very professional with not many juicy bits.

A sachin fan would have liked to know much more about sachin and his views on some critical topics. however reading the book is like revisiting the magic that sachin created all these years. it is a must read for all his fans. i am waiting for another book from the master himself, which will cover the portions left in this book. boria majumdar could have certainly done better in his narration. well,", "This is more like an elaborate Wikipedia article on Sachin Tendulkar - neither a nuanced autobiography nor a great cricket book. There are even a number of proof-reading errors. Looks like a hastily prepared book. I am a Tendulkar fan. So no problem in keeping it as a memorabilia. Non-fans and those looking for serious cricket books or autobiographies may well leave this wide outswinger of a book. He has mastered the art of batting, but not the art of writing or story telling.", "I bought it for my husband who is a diehard Sachin fan...he not only follows his cricketing style but also adores him as the man himself off the field, his ideologies.I thought this book will have enough of the later one so pre-booked and gifted him...But While I started reading it I could just find that other than few small stories here and there Sachin has not really opened up himself  in this book to every situation;he has not stated how he thought,what was his reaction,thought process etc...It is true that he is such a talked about figure that nothing was unknown about him but wanted to see all these hard work,success,humility,honesty from his perspective....I felt that this book lacks that..other than few unknown stories (Anjali chapter, may be a little of Greg Chappel story(this hardly would be 10 liners)) it seemed to me like a match report summary of his entire carrier...Sachin fans please excuse me..but I stand by what I said... Thanks!!", "Tendulkar\u2019s autobiography is similar to his hundredth and last international hundred \u2013 a laboured, mechanical, unspectacular effort against a weak opposition that was perhaps not worth the long wait or the momentousness of the occasion. Like that innings, it achieved a much coveted statistical milestone amid much fanfare but served little other practical purpose and had only momentary glimpses of the genius that the little master is known to be capable of.", "This was a plain cricket commentary with scores and stats and the read was as uninteresting as some of the domestic cricket matches shown in Doordarshan. The language, flow, flair of the book was just ordinary. Thoroughly missed Sachin's analysis on a) what made him the master that he is b) the turnaround of Indian cricket c) his analysis of the different controversies that surrounded Indian cricket.", "Some of the photographs printed are real treasures.", "Very disappointed with this book....waited months for its release but after reading it i felt why it was written. Growing up in India and being a sachin fan i followed him and every news related to him since 1996 world cup, and knew most of the things abt Master (thanks to the media) and it was really sad to find same things written in the autobiography. As mentioned by other reviewers we were expecting something which was not all known to the world.", "Didn't like too much as book neither gives motivation nor inspiration. Book could be more interesting if publishers had removed the unnecessary statistical data.", "\"Some are born-great, some achieve greatness.....some have greatness thrust upon'em!\", Shakespeare says those words and distinguishes greatness in three terms but if he did get the pleasure of watching Sachin Tendulkar, batting on twenty-two yards, I bet my assurance on his will to reword those lines into.....Whatever a great does but hardly flourishes the word 'great' as few have ever done and Sachin stays with them."]},

It's simple and honest just like Sachin himself.", "The book is well written and the enthusiam of Tendulkar is well captured... However could have been better if he himself wrote it. Many times it feels very unlike Tendulkar. Also Tendulkar is made to guiltless in the entire book and all his bad performances are made out to be due to circumstances and luck, which is something untrue.", "Must have for all Sachin fans.

This book has become more fiction like rather an autobiography. There are only good things that he talks about and has remained netural all the other things that happened.", "Read Sachin's autobiography written by Boria Majumdar in about 3 sitting. The first thought on completing the book was how conveniently some topics were removed or just touched briefly to avoid any controversy and how great the book was marketed so that each and everybody should go and read it. Sachin has systematically taken us ( the reader ) step by step from the childhood to retirement. The childhood memories were the best part of the book as it revealed somethings that many of us did not know. Also his great admiration and love for his family is well portrayed and stands in good light for those who follow Sachin - the Bharat Ratna.", "  Overall the book is all about his journey in terms of how many runs he has scored in a match, how he tacked the best of the bowlers, how unlucky he was because of some umpire decisions went against him ( which could have been omitted a few times ) , what he ate after the matches. The book essentially lacks the insights, the dramas, the thought process, and his opinions on others. The book is all about 'my runs', 'my shots', 'my team' and 'my country'. We all love Sachin for what he has done for India and in true sense is a Bharat Ratna. Throughout a carrier of about 20+ years he has shown maturity, dignity and has been humble in all possible conditions he has been put too. But the book definitely lacks a punch; it is rather a a scorecard rather than personal journal.", "A very descriptive autobiography by a very simple and humble man whom we all love and pray for..one who made every Indian forget their own problems for a moment at least .. a stop to whole nation..winning so many hurdles in life and on field..", "Sachin is a immortal man and a hardworking caring person. India is his pride and honour. Cricket was his life for 21 years.

He has filled in dreams  for the next generation through his own examples. He is just putting these and many unknown things about his life for everyone to be inspired to live and work for India as a true humble person.", "Very poor writing (almost high school standards), and hardly any personal insights.

A safe and rather bland offering from which, I would strongly recommend, any bibliophile stay miles away.", "Thanks Amazon for prompt service. Bought it for gifting a sachin fan. He was totally disappointed with it, and told \"Better watch his innings\". This autobiography is not up to expectations. Maybe a fan could write a far better biography for him.", "It was an OK book.

{"reviews": ["Well,this is Sachin's autobiography after all,so don't want to subject it to too much criticism,but overall kind of disappointing. He doesn't open up a lot about controversial things and is politically correct almost all the time. For someone who has played for over 20 years, you expect more from an autobiography.

Every coach/parents read this book to prepare their children for the future.", "Most of what is written in the book is about matches and scores that has already been printed.

I cannot digest Sachin finding fault with Dravid for declaring the innings in Multan, Pakistan because he cannot get his double hundred.

Focus is more on tests and less on ODIs.", "I bought an edition with some great personal photographs of Sachin.", "The book also does provide some dressing room gossips that Indian general fan always looks forward to, but in just the subtle amount. Strong views on Chappel, the 194 declaration by Dravid, some of his ideals and some surprising cricketers Sachin respects... all of these provide little  treats to the reader.", "While some might skim through pages, this book provides some great insight  as to how Sachin used to prepare against some bowlers. How he used to adjust during difficult times. What strategies he used to form. At times I felt, how come Sachin has just hundred 100s, he should be having about 200 centuries. And this might just be the material a teenager, wanting to make a career in cricket might find extremely useful.", "There is humor in appropriate amount. And almost all varities of statistics possible. Whole scorecards have been included.", "This would be an ideal book to gift to your son/sibling if he is thinking of a future in cricket as his career.", "I give it 3.5 stars.", "Being a vivid Sachin fan I expected more of thought process and behind the screens happenings in the game and in the dressing room. But this book is disappointment on this front. This book is more of various essays about all his innings put together.", "Even after reading the book you wont get a feeling that you know Sachin more than before reading it.", "There's nothing in it which we don't know. Rather than describing his hardships and mental make-up for the game, the book just feels like a scorecard and summary of every series he played. If you are not a cricket fan, you should stay away from this and if you are one, then too you will be disappointed with this.", "The book as such reads like a Journal - mostly a running commentary of matches (although important, key matches) which gets monotonous after a while. That is something, since all the matches mentioned are the milestone matches in Sachin's career and for any fan of Indian cricket, that holds considerable interest.", "Sachin's relations within his family, especially with his kids, with teammates, and the food he had during his tours, besides personal anecdotes from some of the matches are broadly the highlights of the book. Also,finer points of his playing technique are mentioned here and there, which would be of interest to the keen follower of the game.", "The part of the book that lets you down is its non-controversial stand on most issues. Match fixing is mentioned only in passing, barely a few pages are dedicated to the Monkeygate scandal. BCCI is held up in high esteem almost everywhere. Most surprisingly, Yuvraj Singh's struggle with cancer and Sachin's stint with the Parliament as a Rajya Sabha member do not find a mention in this book.", "It is still worth buying and reading, because it is Sachin after all. The pictures generously sprinkled within the book are a collector's delight. What strikes one throughout the book is the straightforward, uncomplicated approach that Sachin seems to have towards his life. That alongwith the devotion towards family, the patriotism and the attention to the minutest details of the sport are the key impressions one could treasure, as we complete this book.", "When you follow a sports personality and the game passionately for so long, you'd expect the life story to be equally riveting. This books while good and informative falls short of being great. It seems rather superficial and gives you nothing but a bit more than what is already known about the man. It doesn't help that there are pages and pages of statistics which seem to be there for the sole purpose of filling up pages.", "It would've been nice to have some personal views from the man on things like the match fixing scandal and his views of Azharuddin and Jadeja getting caught in the storm, his relationship with Vinod Kambli or even more anectodes if being on tour. Maybe, like with his batting we come to expect too much from him...", "In last 20 odd years, I loved reading anything written on Sachin and was hoping for great insight about this man. Honestly, it was bit disappointing except for first few chapters and last few chapters. I felt like some of the contents were rushed through in hurry. Though I'm not dissapointed by Sachin himself, but certainly Author has done poor job in extracting best out of Sachin and articulating in rather insightful way. Perhaps, it would have been good idea to write multiple volumes rather than rushing through all in one shot. No matter what, my admiration for Sachin will be same forever.", "Even if Sachin scores reasonable runs but fail to reach 100 then most of us feel as if Sachin failed. That's his stature - we always demand the best of him. So it is obvious that we all must be having Everest high expectations from his book as well.", " Motivation, doubtless dedication, childish fun, a bit of romance, writhing in stress of expectations, bouncing back - this book tells it all. Hands off to the legend for giving very minute details of life even if sometime it is embarrassing and sometime controversial.", " But for some reasons to a great section of book lover it is not going to be a great book. Just like 90+ out score this book does not reciprocate to the highest level of expectations.", "My analysis goes like:", "-> For those who aim to play for state/country this book is a MUST read.", "-> For many cricket lovers who are not interested in technicality of the game  - a few chapters MUST be SKIPPED", "-> For those who have no extra warmth for cricket - only a few chapters can be read", "Finished reading the book \" Playing It My Way\" an autobiography of Sachin Tendulkar. For those in search of any sensational revelations in the book, it is a a disappointment. Nobody expects from a person who has steered clear of any controversy during his playing days, to create any sort of controversy at this stage. Though a major portion of the book just appears as statement of facts, hence repetition of what is already universally known , the author should not be blamed for that because the events surrounding Tendulkar ,on and off the field, have unfolded before us in the last 25 years or so. In the narrative, there are many instances of mind games played and strategies adopted to outwit the opposition which makes up for very interesting reading. A disappointing aspect in the book, however is that the author has not devoted much space to some of his great contemporaries. No mention is made about Kapil Dev's final appearance in test cricket though Sachin was a member of the team at that time. More surprisingly, some of the gem of innings played by Rahul Dravid hardly gets mentioned.Though Rahul and Sachin partnered in Test maches in 143 innings, and scored 6905 runs as partners with 20 century and 29 half century partnerships,it is surprising that Rahul's achievements and his contribution to Indian cricket has not found any place in the book. In this respect, Brian Lara, Sourav Ganguly and V.V.S.Laxman should consider themselves slightly better off.", "To sum up, much more was expected from Sachin Tendulkar,not only about himself, but also for his insights about those greats who played along with him and against him.", "finished it ....sachin is the best....we saw ....funny ....naughty....normal....emotional....family guy....sachin's journey through his eyes...", ".how he achieved the greatness.....but remain gentle....kind....always on the ground...only his bat talked....countless pains ....sacrifices...sheer hard work......passion....compassion......the man we all loved....lived his dream with our dream.....the tears on his failure...the joy n celebration on every little success ,he had we all had....our world stopped whenever he played....nothing else mattered ....his nervous nineties made us nervous....his 100s made us forget personal failures...a 16 year boy ....Indian conquered the world......we all did....honesty...kindness...politeness.....hard work....optimism...are his virtue...simplicity at its true beauty...an artist... true bharat ratna....world ambassador.....you will always be in our heart....will watch your innings again and again and again....we love u....thank u sachin"]},

Fans of the master-blaster are treated to delightful strokes of not the bat but the pen as the batting legend discussed all aspects of his life that have not been shared previously.", "Beginning with his childhood, the memoir is a journey through the life of Sachin through twenty-eight informative and insightful chapters, from the first time he lifted the bat to his last walk back to the pavilion. It is as much a memoir of Sachin as much as it is a history of cricket in India.", "Sachin\u2019s autobiography covers his family, wife Anjali, his first tour, his captaincy of the Indian cricket team, the period that severely tested his career, about music: his second love, the highs and lows of his prolific career and the glorious World Cup triumph. While Sachin\u2019s life has been an open book, fans will get to know him better through this memoir as he shared many personal thoughts which will surprised many.", "Sachin\u2019s autobiography will also benefit charitable causes as the proceeds from the sale of Playing It My Way: My Autobiography by Sachin Tendulkar with Boria Majumdar will be used to support two charitable causes: the alleviation of malnutrition in children and the provision of clean water to the underprivileged. All the more reasons for fans to buy the book, if not for keepsake alone!", "This is an autibiography that would appeal to the diehard sachin fans. For me personally, it was a nostalgic read , reliving all his matches with some interesting titbits here and there. But for someone who hasn't followed his career so closely or someone who is cricket neutral , an endless grind of all his matches awaits you!", "Great insights into the mind of one of the best batsman of the world. Some of the instances on how he interprets the ball before it is delivered talks volumes about the ability of this individual. Ideal only for people who have followed Indian cricket over years. The last part i.e. his retirement speech still gives goosebumps.", "Great read... If u r an avid cricket fan then u can relate to the tournaments Sachin mentions... If u don't follow cricket closely u will still enjoy learning about the game. We often feel that Sachin is an effortless player but this book shows the immense hardwork he has put in and how consciously Sachin tries to be grounded", "Like every one I also hoped the best from him.But it was not like an autobiography but can tell it as match to match statistics.Because it is really not an autobiography as written by Boria Mazumdar and Sachin has given him interviews.But it is not bad to buy it.Some recalls from Sachin about his life are worth to know....", "I bought the autobiography with a lot of expectations and none were fulfilled - not written interestingly enough and not much insight into what was happening in his mind and in the cricket field. The silence on the match fixing controversy which affected so many of his colleagues is very disappointing. Overall a poor buy", "Its an Awesome Book for Sachin Fans Specially when you take him as your God. And yes for non Sachin fans too its a wonderful book to read some real life fact files of the super human. Does not let you down. And yes if you have Sachin fans who don't buy the book gift them one as i did.

Sorry..... \"SUPERMAN\"", "Amazing book with amazing illustrations. Brings back memories of childhood and eager waiting of master blaster to come on pitch. The alacrity with which Sachin has faced so many injuries and still served nation through cricket is totally inspiring. Respect aa hi jata hai bande ke liye... Sab padh ke.", "It's give me to close view about sachin life. it's a really good to know the secrete thing in sachin life.His passion about game as a team player, as a supportive senior , friendship , people expectation and much more.. I love this book. Thanks Sachin for this great gift to your love-once."]},
{"reviews": ["his autobiography contains the content which we all generally know through media barring few photos. Nothing interesting or any more insights into the dressing room chats, controversies and their discussions etc, hence making it an OK read.", "Not what I expected from an autobiography. This seems to be just a chronological summary of Sachin's playing career without any soul in it - it just goes on to say \"this happened, then this happened, then this happened\". I don't mind that he skipped the match fixing and spot fixing controversies, but then there is nothing in terms of how the team was built, what was the team mindset in Australia '02 - '03, or Kolkata '01... there seems to be no feeling in what has been written. To be fair, there are some poignant passages - like WC'99 when Sachin's father died and the Kenya match after that when he go 140*, or when Dravid declared in Multan with him on 194* or his epic 241* in Sydney, but there are few and far in between.", "Compared to something like Agassi's autobiography, this makes for very bland reading. It's just like the man himself, totally non controversial. Maybe my expectations were high but in all fairness, what a cricinfo.com editor like Sid Vaidyanathan or Sid Monga writes about cricket impacts me more than this book did.", "Its is an easy book  to read. More enjoyable by cricket fans who can relive their memories of watching sachin batting. However it does feel underwhelming for those expecting a detailed analysis of state of cricket during the last 25 years.", "Reads like a text. Plain and simple, to the extent of being labelled as boring! Sachin doesn't share his insights about the game, and his thoughts on critical issues like match-fixing. May be he played the game just for its enjoyment, and made a shield wall around himself and avoided all other thoughts.", "excellent. a true portrayal of  Sachin's personal and professional life.", "made a very pleasant reading..simple and lucid presentation.", "on page 7 at the last para, Dreaming of a bicycle, it is \"a\" instead of\" I\".", "Thanks Sachin for a wonderful book and to make or life more beautiful . You are an inspiration to all of us and this book just ignites the spark more strongly . Dear viewers if you read this book it is going to be a lifetime experience", "The story telling is honestly not that great but it's Sachins story so its gotta be worth reading! Its like going to Kashmir and taking a picture, it doesn't matte how (not) skilled the photographer is, it's going to be an amazing one.", "This is a must read.  Started reading it and could not stop before it finished.  An isight to Sachin's life.  Some of the controvorsies were not discussed which leaves viewers wanting for just a bit  more.  All in ll a great reading.", "Expected more intense and less crib from sachin.
